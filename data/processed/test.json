E-MAIL ; mm_m_17johnson@yahoo.com.au DEAR SIR, Compliments of the day,I understand quite well that this message will sound so strange to you but it is a very serious matter that we need to tackle together very urgent. Before i proceed further,Let me formally introduce myself to you .I am MR. JOHNSON MUGABE, 30 years of age, the first adopted son of president Robert Mugabe, the current Zimbabwean President. I am contacting you today for an urgent assistance to transfer into your account the sum of US$ 19.8 ( NINTEEN POINT EIGHT MILION STATES DOLLARS). I hope that you may be aware of the recent differences that is going on rigth now between my father and the opposition party in my country, this also brought about the commonwealth community sanctioning my father and freezing all his foreign account both in America and britain.This decision was carried out during the 4 days Commonwealth meeting that was held in Malawi in a part of South East Africa recently. It will interest you to hear that i never supported my fathers treatment to the white zimbabwean citizens, and this has seriously brought about some personal misunderstanding between me and my father.I have been opposing him since the past five (7) years. Fight so hard to see that he leaves the presidential seat after governing for past 32 years On this account i disassociated myself from him and we do not have any thing in common right now.He even forced me to leave the country with immediate effect after receiving the sanction from the common wealth community, Although he thought that i am behind his delimma. In the year 2004 when i was in good term with my father, he gave me a treasure box containing the sum of US$19.8 milion to deposite in a private security company in Thailand for safe keeping, So i did exactly as he instructed me without disclosing the actual content of the box to the security company,every documents was signed and documented in my names and details.This money has been lying in the security company for the past 8 months. Now that he sent me out on exile, i left zimbabwe to Thailand where i am currently seeking political assylum.My aim of travelling to Thailand was to claim the money and transfer it out of Thailand to any other country that will be safe for investment. I am contacting you therefore on the account that you will support me to secure the fund in good condition and also come over to Thailand so that we can both claim the fund together, and then we travel down to your country for proper investment of the fund. I have visited the security company and made every neccessary enquiry concerning the fund and it is still intact in the security house.I will compensate you with 7%of the total sum (i.e US$ 1,386 000.00) and i have set aside another 8% (i.e US$1,584 000.00) for any expenses that may be incured during the transaction. Please this is a very confidential matter that needs utmost secrecy and confidentiality, so i am really pleading to you to try as much as possible to keep every aspect of this confidential. Please also do not reveal it to any one as my hope and futture solely depend on this money and if you are willing to work with me and assist me on this transaction,then do not hesitate to contact me immediately by sending me your TELEPHONE and FAX NUMBERS,and reply me through my e-mail address for us to carry on with the next step of the transaction. Hoping to receive your positive response soonest. BEST REGARDS, MR. JOHNSON MUGABE",

DEAR SIR/MADAM, (PRIVATE & CONFIDENTIAL) I AM GARUBA UMARU THE MANAGER IN CHARGE OF BILL AND EXCHANGE SECTION OF AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A D B) OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO IN WEST AFRICA.WITH DUE RESPECT AND EGARD I HAVE DECIDED TO CONTACT YOU ON A BUSINESS TRANSACTION THAT WILL BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO BOTH OF US AT THE END OF THE TRANSACTION. DURING OUR INVESTIGATION AND AUDITING IN THIS BANK, MY DEPARTMENT CAME ACROSS A VERY HUGE SUM OF MONEY BELONGING TO A DECEASED PERSON WHO DIED ON NOVEMBER 2001 IN A PLANE CRASH AND THE FUND HAS BEEN DORMANT IN HIS ACCOUNT WITH THIS BANK WITHOUT ANY CLAIM OF THE FUND IN OUR CUSTODY EITHER FROM HIS FAMILY OR RELATION BEFORE MY DISCOVERY TO THIS DEVELOPMENT. ALTHOUGH PERSONALLY, I KEEP THIS INFORMATION SECRET WITHIN MYSELF TO ENABLE THE WHOLE PLANS AND IDEA BE PROFITABLE AND SUCCESSFUL DURING THE TIME OF EXECUTION. THE SAID AMOUNT WAS SUM OF $ TWENTY TWO MILLION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($22.3M) MEANWHILE ALL THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENT TO PUT CLAIM OVER THIS FUND AS THE BONAFIDE NEXT OF KIN TO THE DECEASED, GET THE REQUIRED APPROVAL AND TRANSFER THIS MONEY TO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE AND DIRECTIVES AND NEEDED INFORMATION WILL BE RELAYED TO YOU AS SOON AS YOU INDICATE YOUR INTEREST AND WILLINGNESS TO ASSIST ME AND ALSO BENEFIT YOUR SELF TO THIS GREAT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL Dear Sir/madam I sincerely write to seek your co-operation and trust to enable my colleagues and I carry out an urgent business opportunity in my department. I work with the Union Bank of Nigeria PLC; currently I am the senior manager of bills and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my bank. I was the account officer to one Mr. Ali B. Ashraf who died along with his family on the 8th of November 1996 in an ADC Boeing 727 plane crash at Egirin River. All 141 passengers on board were feared dead. He left in his domiciliary account the total sum of Sixty Five Million United States Dollars [$65million] Since the management got the information of his death we have been expecting any of his relation or his next of kin to come up and claim his money. Unfortunately from the day of his death till the time of this letter none of his relation or friends has come up for the claim. The banking and financial law of Union bank of Nigeria Plc stipulates that if such fund remained unclaimed after a period of four years (4) it will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. On this discovery sir, I and a colleague of mine now decided do business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin to Ali B. Ashraf for safety and subsequent disbursement. I will soon proceed for my retirement in the middle of this year, and I personally do not want this fund to be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. That is why I wanted the fund to be move out of the bank before I proceed on my retirement from the banking services by june 15th 2003. The need for a foreigner as next of kin in this project is occasioned by the fact that the customer Mr. Ali Ashraf was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot stand as his next of kin or heir. We have agreed that 15% of the Fund would be for you as foreign partner; thereafter my colleague and I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. To enable the immediate transfer of the fund into your nominated account, you will first apply to the bank as the next of kin of the deceased, indicating your bank account number and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your acknowledgement indicating your interest, I will send to you the text of the application that you will send to the Union Bank authority for an approval to submit your claims. Send your reply through my direct private email address and indicate your direct Fax and telephone numbers for effective communication that this transaction is required. Do not reply through the union bank email address because it will fall at the receptionist's desk and is for public use . Please note that you are not to appear in person, as every thing regarding this project will be strictly on documentations and every banking documents needed for this transaction will be taken care of by my self.

    "body_text": "From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family, Johannesburg,South Africa. My Dear , Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes. My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block an! d confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood. During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugab! e's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit. Now this is what I actually want you to do for me; 1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office. 2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.

Phone (00226-7885 75 97) PLANE CRASH WEB SITE...http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm (\"REMITTANCE OF $15 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS CONFIDENTIAL IS THE CASE\") Compliment Of The Season, On a very good day. I am (bala tomson Esq),the Head of file Department in African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist search. When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer. You should contact me on my number (00226-7885 75 97) immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. Yours faithfully, BALA TOMSON (Esq.) POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As you finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well over this business.",

I am contacting you of a business transfer, of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that everything has been well taken care off, and all will be well at the end of the day. I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction. To ease your apprehension, I got your contact from the British chambers of commerce and industry, foreign trade division. An account was open by a foreigner named Gerald Welsh who died in an air crash along with his wife on the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. PROPOSITION; Since his death, none of his next-of-kin are alive to make claims for this money as his heir, because they all died in the same accident(May his soul rest in peace). We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked out by a lawyer for the funds Twenty- five million United States dollars (US$25,000,000.00) in a domiciliary account to be released in your favour as the beneficiary's next of kin. Because after six years the money will be called back to the bank treasury as unclaimed bills and the money shared amongst the directors of the bank. so it is on this note i decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to share this money amongst themselves at the end of the year. It may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries. Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information if you are interested. 1.A Beneficiary name;. In order for me to prepare the PAPER WORK for transfer of the funds in your name. And also I want you to come down to South Africa to open a non-resident account for onward transfer to your overseas account, and for us to see face to face. 2. Details, particulars of your contact address. 3. Direct Telephone and fax numbers;. For our personal contact and for the confidentiality of this transactions. I shall be compensating you with 25% of the total sum on final conclusion of this project for your assistance, as I have also thought of doling out 5% to charity organisation from your locality based on your recommendation another 5% for the services of the lawyer while the balance 65% shall be for me for investment purposes in your country as I cannot bring back this cash to my country. If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endeavor to contact me immediately.

Your information were given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black Economic Empowerment Commission (Government) delegation on a trip to the United States during a bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties, and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this business. Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work as the Director of Project Implementation, with co-operation of two other top officials, we have in our possession, an overdue payment in US funds. The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$41,500,000.00 (Forty One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed. The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private investment in general, and foreign direct investment in particular, are the real engines for sustainable economic development, for which reason it has continued to encouraged investment in the key growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere determination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them, so as to continue to enjoy close relationship, and mutually beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we included our bills for approvals with the co-operation of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign account. The changing of beneficiary's information/ details and other forms of documentation upon application for claim to reflect the contract money and its approvals will be secured on behalf of your company or your self. I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that, should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be 20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%, and the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses so incurred. It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other companies. More often than not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields win major contracts, and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution. This business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. Also your specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us.

    "body_text": "Letter From: Daniel Kabila Johannesburg, South Africa INVESTMENT OFFER Greetings, In appreciation of your esteemed contact received through a reliable source and the choice of your country I wish to introduce myself, I am Daniel Kabila the son of the late Democratic Republic of Congo President Laurent Desire Kabila of the blessed memory. I know this letter might come to you as a surprise but I honestly do not intend to surprise you. I write this letter in respect of my intention to invest the sum of Twelve Million United State Dollars with you. I inherited this money from my mother. This money was got through the smuggling and sale of Diamond and Timber when my father was the head of state. My mother though not her legal wife used her privilege position to engage in the business of Diamond and Timber since she knows that her survival will depend on how much she can get out of the privilege situation. When my father was assassinated on 16TH Jan. 01 by one of his bodyguards Lt.Rashidi Kasereke through the conspiracy of some top army officers that wanted to topple him I escaped to South Africa because of the fear that I might be arrested by my half brother Lt. General Joseph Kabila the present head of state. Actually his mother and my mother are not in the best of relationship because of who among them will be the first lady tussle and this ultimately affected us their children. Considering the relationship between South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo new government, my mother advised me to leave For South Africa for security reason, while the funds were deposited with a security Company in Europe. On getting to South Africa where I have been living since then as a political refugee I am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me in moving this money out for safe banking and profitable investment. Honestly I contacted you because I don't want to invest this money in South Africa due to my status here as a political Refugee. And moreover I wouldn't want to take risk because this money is all that I and my Mother is depending on because My half brother has seized all my father's assets and money and left I and my mother empty handed without knowing about this funds deposited at the Security Company in Europe so that is why I decided that investing this money abroad should be the best investment for me. I will be honored if I can be given the privilege of investing this money with your help. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distress call to save my mother and I from a hopeless future. And if you agree, I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort in this regard with 20% of the total money and annual 5% of the after tax returns on investment for the first three years. Thereafter, the term shall be varied 5% for expenses, which may arise during the transaction, fax and phone bills inclusive. When the money is moved into your discrete account, you will be allowed to draw 20% your favor, while the remaining 70% will be invested meaningfully for our future if possible in your area of business and deterrents sectors of the Economy in your country which are dividends yielding. Whatever your decision is please reach me immediately and keep this letter tight secret for the interest of my family. Best Regards, Daniel Kabila Email: dankabila4eva100@teenmail.co.za",

    "original_text": "\nLetter From: Daniel Kabila\nJohannesburg, South Africa\n\nINVESTMENT OFFER\n\nGreetings,\n In appreciation of your esteemed contact received through a reliable source \nand the choice of your country I wish to introduce myself, I am Daniel \nKabila the son of the late Democratic Republic of Congo President Laurent \nDesire Kabila of the blessed memory. I know this letter might come to you as \na surprise but I honestly do not intend to surprise you. I write this letter \nin respect of my intention to invest the sum of Twelve Million United State \nDollars with you. I inherited this money from my mother. This money was got \nthrough the smuggling and sale of Diamond and Timber when my father was the \nhead of state. My mother though not her legal wife used her privilege \nposition to engage in the business of Diamond and Timber since she knows \nthat her survival will depend on how much she can get out of the privilege \nsituation.\n\nWhen my father was assassinated on 16TH Jan. 01 by one of his bodyguards \nLt.Rashidi Kasereke through the conspiracy of some top army officers that \nwanted to topple him I escaped to South Africa because of the fear that I \nmight be arrested by my half brother Lt. General Joseph Kabila the present \nhead of state. Actually his mother and my mother are not in the best of \nrelationship because of who among them will be the first lady tussle and \nthis ultimately affected us their children. Considering the relationship \nbetween South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo new government, my \nmother advised me to leave For South Africa for security reason, while the \nfunds were deposited with a security Company in Europe.\n\nOn getting to South Africa where I have been living since then as a \npolitical refugee I am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me in \nmoving this money out for safe banking and profitable investment. Honestly I \ncontacted you because I don't want to invest this money in South Africa due \nto my status here as a political Refugee. And moreover I wouldn't want to \ntake risk because this money is all that I and my Mother is depending on \nbecause My half brother has seized all my father's assets and money and left \nI and my mother empty handed without knowing about this funds deposited at \nthe Security Company in Europe so that is why I decided that investing this \nmoney abroad should be the best investment for me.

My name is Hassan diouf,the only son of late Mr.Mohammed Diouf who was the chairman /President/CEO,Cacao-Cafe & Agro-Alimentary industries plc.SCAFECAO)\"Bouake\" and ex-owner of Polyclinic LA-MADONNE, of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire. You can find the story on this website:http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2269238.stm On 19th of September 2002,a group of so called rebels took over the city of Bouake to over-throw the Government of Mr.Laurent Gbagbo the President of Cote d'Ivoire. On the 20th day morning at about 4:18am some fractions of the same group of rebels break into our house and killed our security guard and pass-through the gate entrance to the main building and took my father away to an un-known destination. After about four hours later we found him (my father) at the road side, by then he had been totally beaten and was bleeding to death lying in the pool of his own blood. From there, we rushed him to a near by hospital and hours later he sent for my mother. So he told her that he can not make it from the doctors diagnosis, he also told her that it was because he (my father) was not from the northern part of the country that he has been treated this way and also being a political activist. And again he said he is suspecting some of his business partners for conspiracy and this sort of brutality. He also told my mother that he deposited a huge amount of money i.e US$ 10.5million dollars(Ten million five hundred thousand us dollars only) into a Bank in the Capital city of Dakar Senegal he also told my mother where he kept the whole documents concerning this deposit that is made for investment purpose in the western world. That same day, he (my father) gave up the ghost. Then with the help of the French soldiers, we escaped to Senegal, where we are now. I am now contacting you believing you are honest and trustworthy to help us to receive the money in your account for investment, I and my mother has decided in compensating you 30%of the total amount for your assistance . Please do take your time to go through the mail and get back to us, so that I will simply introduce you to the Bank where the fund are being kept now for onward transfer. So you can contact me through my alternate email adress for security reason. Email hassan_diouf@walla.com am waiting for your response. Thanks and God bless. Hassan Diouf . For the Family's",

On the 20th day morning at about 4:18am some fractions of the same group of rebels break into our house and killed our security guard and pass-through the gate entrance to the main building and took my father away to an un-known destination.\nAfter about four hours later we found him (my father) at the road side, by then he had been totally beaten and was bleeding to death lying in the pool of his own blood. From there, we rushed him to a near by hospital and hours later he sent for my mother. So he told her that he can not make it from the doctors diagnosis, he also told her that it was because he (my father) was not from the northern part of the country that he has been treated this way and also being a political activist. And again he said he is suspecting some of his business partners for conspiracy and this sort of brutality. He also told my mother that he deposited a huge amount of money i.e US$ 10.5million dollars(Ten million five hundred thousand us dollars only) into a Bank in the Capital city of Dakar Senegal he also told my mother where he kept the whole documents concerning this deposit that is made for investment purpose in the western world.\nThat same day, he (my father) gave up the ghost. Then with the help of the French soldiers, we escaped to Senegal, where we are now. I am now contacting you believing you are honest and trustworthy to help us to receive the money in your account for investment, I and my mother has decided in compensating you 30%of the total amount for your assistance .\nPlease do take your time to go through the mail and get back to us, so that I will simply introduce you to the Bank where the fund are being kept now for onward transfer. So you can contact me through my alternate email adress for security reason.\nEmail hassan_diouf@walla.com am waiting for your response.\nThanks and God bless.\nHassan Diouf .\nFor the Family's\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n"

I got your contact when i was making some searches in the internet. My name is Mrs Atiya Mohameed, a Liberian. I was until recently the wife of Mr. Ibrahim Mohameed who was the chief army officer to my country Libera. I am contacting you to seek your co-operation in investing $USD10.M in your company or your country,s economy. My husband made this money when he was on sit as the commander and chief army officer while Charles Taylor is the president of Liberia. Due to some religious and political problems , my husband was hijacked and brutally assasainated by the rebel leathers in Liberia. It is worthy to note that during my husband's life time he used his position as a former chief aid to must have made this money in question. This money was realised from the sales of gold and diamond ,which are the country's major resources and sources of income.And before his death ,my husband was able to send this money via a Ghanian diplomatic contact to the country ,where it is currently secured with a security company as a FAMILY TREASURE and my name was used as the depositor in view of my husband,s position as an insider in the government. And it was my husband,s refusal to realise the money to former President Charles Taylor that resulted in the killing in February 2003. Now , that i have passed through the mourning ordeal for my husband I am thinking and planning the next step to take with respect to how and where to invest the money. So my aim of sending this mail to you is to solicit your assistance in transfering this money to your country where it could be invested in a viable business for our mutual benefit. I am ready to enter into a joint venture with your company or we can open a new company with the money because i'm sure the money inside the box can establish a company of any type. I want to assure you that you will be highly rewarded for your assistance both in cash or in the joint venture. Please reply to this mail, indicating your ability to handle this transaction so that i will give you details to enable us map out strategies for the implementation of this project. Best regards, Mrs.Atiya Mohameed",

A few year's ago I was in Baghdad,Iraq where I had established a little congregation where I preached regularly,but the war escaleted and the church was converted to a hospital of soughts. Before then, On one faithfull day three American Soldiers came to me and left a trunk box of Money with me and swore to come back for it. When the war in Iraq intensified I was escorted to My country Benin Republic West africa, by the U.S soliers who felt the content of the trunk box was church documents and never cared to check the trunk box,, when I was getting fraustrated I returned to Iraq only to find out that two of the three Soldiers died in Battle while the last was decleared MIA (Missing in Action). Now I have the fund which belongs to the soldiers and which is Eight million us dollars ($8,000.000.00),but i have deposited it with a security company here in my country Benin Rep, and I was contacted in a letter dated 10th of May.2006 by the company asking me to indicate if I was in reciept of the letter as a sign that I am still living and still subscribed for their service. I am interested in using a small fraction of this money,much less than ten percent for a re-organisation of the work, but I do not need the rest and do not want to have any direct dealing with it, I need someone who will be able to use the fund better maybe for charity or something universally profitable, I have thought of doing it my self but, my ministry is the apocalypse and I believe and preach the soon comming which make me not indulgent in reliance on money or wealth in any form. I also do not have the money that has accrued on the service and safe deposit of the company that holds the trunk box, I will be glad if you have any interest in the direction of maybe managing or transmitting the fund as you prefer in your capacity like using it to help the motherless and people in the 3rd world countries.

My father is one of the best farmers in our country and because he did not support Mugabe's ideas,Mugabe's supporters invaded my father's farm and burnt everything in the farm,killing my father and made away with a lot of items in my father's farm.

    "body_text": "Dear Sir/Madam Compliment of the day to you . I got your contact through business search from the internet. I am Mrs.Kate Masul, Account Manager of Standard Chartered Bank Kanashie Branch . I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On December 29th 2002, an American contractor with the Government of Ghana, Mr. Michael Creek made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at TWENTY TWO Million,Four hundred thousand dollars ($22.4million) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, that Mr. Michael Creek died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Michael Creek did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of $22.4million is still sitting in Standard Chartered Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it. According to the laws of the country, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to assist me fully as foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Michael creek, so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavites, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you while 10% will be set aside for miscellaneous expenses. There is no risk involved in this transaction, as every necessary paperwork for this fund, will be done and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. Hope this mail will meet your perfect understanding. Best Regards. Mrs.Kate Masul",

    "body_text": "-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1 Ok, time for me to pipe in. :) Honestly, I find it odd that the spam fighting groups aren't working and playing well, when the common enemy is the spammers, not each other. MAPS and ORBS had a battle for a while, and now DCC seems to have issues with Razor. Honestly, work on your own stuff, and let's fix the spam problem, not pull out rulers. In a spam filter, I'm much, much more concerned about false positives than false negatives. Additionally, since spam types are so varied, I use all available and trustworthy (to me) methods to detect it. I tend to want something that has three levels (although nothing like this exists, yet): red is most certainly spam, verified by high ratings from several sources, and noone says \"I know this is NOT spam.\" I'd probably drop this into a bit-bucket, or archive it for humor value. I expect no false-positives to be here. yellow This may be spam. A human should decide (and report). green This is probably not spam. spamassassin does something useful here, but it only has the is/isn't switch, not is/maybe/isn't. That said, razor is but one check in my spam fighting arsenal, so if it reports \"doesn't match known spam\" once in a while for well-known spam, something else will probably get it. - --Michael -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.0.7 (NetBSD) Comment: See http://www.flame.org/~explorer/pgp for my keys iD8DBQE9Uxknl6Nz7kJWYWYRAqZVAKCAD46joOEZbIk+8Hx3ZGkVQ7eGZwCfRB+V T67XLOPP4vG99Fg2h72gHek= =Evue -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Razor-users mailing list Razor-users@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users",

MAPS and ORBS had a battle for a while, and now DCC seems to\nhave issues with Razor.  Honestly, work on your own stuff, and let's\nfix the spam problem, not pull out rulers.\n\nIn a spam filter, I'm much, much more concerned about false positives\nthan false negatives.  Additionally, since spam types are so varied, I\nuse all available and trustworthy (to me) methods to detect it.  I\ntend to want something that has three levels (although nothing like\nthis exists, yet):\n\n        red     is most certainly spam, verified by high ratings from\n                several sources, and noone says \"I know this is NOT\n                spam.\"  I'd probably drop this into a bit-bucket, or\n                archive it for humor value.  I expect no\n                false-positives to be here.\n\n        yellow  This may be spam.  A human should decide (and report).\n\n        green   This is probably not spam.\n\nspamassassin does something useful here, but it only has the is/isn't\nswitch, not is/maybe/isn't.  That said, razor is but one check in my\nspam fighting arsenal, so if it reports \"doesn't match known spam\"\nonce in a while for well-known spam, something else will probably get\nit.\n\n- --Michael\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.0.7 (NetBSD)\nComment: See http://www.flame.org/~explorer/pgp for my keys\n\niD8DBQE9Uxknl6Nz7kJWYWYRAqZVAKCAD46joOEZbIk+8Hx3ZGkVQ7eGZwCfRB+V\nT67XLOPP4vG99Fg2h72gHek=\n=Evue\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nRazor-users mailing list\nRazor-users@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/razor-users\n\n\n"

So we're all in agreement then. Except for Marc. So what brilliant metric do you have in mind to measure unsolicited vs. solicited commercial email? I know I've registered for many commercial lists that send material that really reads like spam. Moreover, spammers will be able to circumvent SA if they make spam look like this SCE. This kind of convergence of the two.... well, it stinks. We can kill SCE, or we can cripple identification of UCE. Obviously an interim solution is to whitelist, but long term is probably harder. What kind of SCE, like MSDN newsletters, product updates, etc is in the corpus for the GA? Maybe seeding the corpus with a bigger set of these type of mails will have some interesting/useful results.

So we're all in agreement then.  Except for Marc.\n\nSo what brilliant metric do you have in mind to measure unsolicited vs.\nsolicited commercial email?\n\nI know I've registered for many commercial lists that send material that\nreally reads like spam.  Moreover, spammers will be able to circumvent\nSA if they make spam look like this SCE.  This kind of convergence of the\ntwo.... well, it stinks.  We can kill SCE, or we can cripple\nidentification of UCE.\n\nObviously an interim solution is to whitelist, but long term is probably\nharder.  What kind of SCE, like MSDN newsletters, product updates, etc\nis in the corpus for the GA?  Maybe seeding the corpus with a bigger set\nof these type of mails will have some interesting/useful results.\n\nRoss Vandegrift\nross@willow.seitz.com\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nSpamassassin-talk mailing list\nSpamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk\n\n\n"

By showing that it can be done, they inspire others to follow in their path, or so they hope. I take some objection to the belabouring of the term fantasy, because it is somewhat perjorative. Imagining different worlds can often lead the world to become more like that imagined. Moreso if action is taken on the basis of those imaginings. Theres an interesting parralel with the great capitalist dream that anyone can make anything happen through hard work and a bit of luck. This is equally a fantasy, but one made to approach reality through consensus. An interesting question then becomes, if Al Queda's actions are in furtherance of a fantasy, what fantasies are George Bush's actions in furtherace of? How many of the actions of George Bush and the US are performed for their effect on the US population? For example, how much showmanship has been put into rebuilding the morale of wall street. Is this not as much a spirtual investment as the sacrifices Al Queda made? What cultural myopia is in play here in the US? I make a point of reading Australian, Britsish and US news. Today I noticed that the Australian and British news are featuring the Iraqi overtures to the UN on inspectors, while US news is featuring Iraqi war preparations (digging bunkers etc). At a time that the US is withdrawing from international cooperation on multiple levels, the fantasy of being surrounded by enemies (invisible preferably) is somewhat appealing. A self fullfilling prophesy, if you like. Perhaps that's whats at work here. http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",

This piece has been up on the wall of our CTO's office for years. It deserves to be forked, or even reforked. - Joe (BTW, RAID is the home-grown bug tracking system used at Microsoft. See e.g. http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/CrossTalk/1995/oct/Shippin.asp. It was a fine tool, better than any other I've had to use...) The Bug Count Also Rises by John Browne (Imitation Hemingway Contest Winner) In the fall of that year the rains fell as usual and washed the leaves of the dust and dripped from the leaves onto the ground. The shuttles drove through the rainy streets and took the people to meetings, then later brought them back, their tires spraying the mist into the air. Many days he stood for a long time and watched the rain and the shuttles and drank his double-tall mochas. With the mochas he was strong. Hernando who worked down the hall and who was large with microbrews came to him and told him that the ship day was upon them but the bugs were not yet out. The bugs which were always there even when you were in Cafes late at night sipping a Redhook or a double-tall mocha and you thought you were safe but they were there and although Enrico kept the floor swept clean and the mochas were hot the bugs were there and they ate at you. When Hernando told him this he asked how many bugs. \"The RAID is huge with bugs,\" Hernando said. \"The bugs are infinite.\" \"Why do you ask me? You know I cannot do this thing anymore with the bugs.\" \"Once you were great with the bugs,\" Hernando said. \"No one was greater,\" he said again. \"Even Prado.\" \"Prado? What of Prado? Let Prado fix the bugs.\" Hernando shrugged. \"Prado is finished. He was gored by three Sev 2's in Chicago. All he does now is drink herb tea and play with his screensavers.\" \"Herb tea?\" \"It is true, my friend.\" Hernando shrugged again. Later he went to his office and sat in the dark for a long time. Then he sent e-mail to Michaels. Michaels came to him while he was sipping a mocha. They sat silently for awhile, then he asked Michaels, \"I need you to triage for me.\" Michaels looked down. \"I don't do that anymore,\" he said. \"This is different. The bugs are enormous. There are an infinity of bugs.\" \"I'm finished with that,\" Michaels said again. \"I just want to live quietly.\" \"Have you heard Prado is finished? He was badly gored. Now he can only drink herb tea.\" \"Herb tea?\" Michaels said. \"It is true,\" he said sorrowfully. Michaels stood up. \"Then I will do it, my friend,\" he said formally. \"I will do it for Prado, who was once great with the bugs. I will do it for the time we filled Prado's office with bouncy balls, and for the time Prado wore his nerf weapons in the marketing hall and slew all of them with no fear and only a great joy at the combat. I will do it for all the pizza we ate and the bottles of Coke we drank.\" Together they walked slowly back, knowing it would be good. As they walked the rain dripped softly from the leaves, and the shuttles carried the bodies back from the meetings. -- The Combatant State is your father and your mother, your only protector, the totality of your interests.

This piece has been up on the wall of our\nCTO's office for years. It deserves to be forked, or even reforked.\n\n- Joe\n\n(BTW, RAID is the home-grown bug tracking system used at Microsoft.\nSee e.g. http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/CrossTalk/1995/oct/Shippin.asp.\nIt was a fine tool, better than any other I've had to use...)\n\n\n\nThe Bug Count Also Rises\n\n\nby John Browne\n(Imitation Hemingway Contest Winner)\n\nIn the fall of that year the rains fell as usual and washed the leaves \nof the dust and dripped from the leaves onto the ground. The shuttles \ndrove through the rainy streets and took the people to meetings, then \nlater brought them back, their tires spraying the mist into the air.\n\nMany days he stood for a long time and watched the rain and the shuttles \nand drank his double-tall mochas. With the mochas he was strong.\n\nHernando who worked down the hall and who was large with microbrews came \nto him and told him that the ship day was upon them but the bugs were \nnot yet out. The bugs which were always there even when you were in \nCafes late at night sipping a Redhook or a double-tall mocha and you \nthought you were safe but they were there and although Enrico kept the \nfloor swept clean and the mochas were hot the bugs were there and they \nate at you.\n\nWhen Hernando told him this he asked how many bugs. \"The RAID is huge \nwith bugs,\" Hernando said. \"The bugs are infinite.\"\n\n\"Why do you ask me? You know I cannot do this thing anymore with the bugs.\"\n\n\"Once you were great with the bugs,\" Hernando said. \"No one was \ngreater,\" he said again. \"Even Prado.\"\n\n\"Prado? What of Prado? Let Prado fix the bugs.\"\n\nHernando shrugged. \"Prado is finished. He was gored by three Sev 2's in \nChicago. All he does now is drink herb tea and play with his screensavers.\"\n\n\"Herb tea?\"\n\n\"It is true, my friend.\" Hernando shrugged again. Later he went to his \noffice and sat in the dark for a long time. Then he sent e-mail to Michaels.\n\nMichaels came to him while he was sipping a mocha. They sat silently for \nawhile, then he asked Michaels, \"I need you to triage for me.\"\n\nMichaels looked down. \"I don't do that anymore,\" he said.\n\n\"This is different. The bugs are enormous. There are an infinity of bugs.\"\n\n\"I'm finished with that,\" Michaels said again. \"I just want to live \nquietly.\"\n\n\"Have you heard Prado is finished? He was badly gored. Now he can only \ndrink herb tea.\"\n\n\"Herb tea?\" Michaels said.\n\n\"It is true,\" he said sorrowfully.\n\nMichaels stood up. \"Then I will do it, my friend,\" he said formally. \"I \nwill do it for Prado, who was once great with the bugs. I will do it for \nthe time we filled Prado's office with bouncy balls, and for the time \nPrado wore his nerf weapons in the marketing hall and slew all of them \nwith no fear and only a great joy at the combat. I will do it for all \nthe pizza we ate and the bottles of Coke we drank.\"\n\nTogether they walked slowly back, knowing it would be good. As they \nwalked the rain dripped softly from the leaves, and the shuttles carried \nthe bodies back from the meetings.\n\n-- \nThe Combatant State is your father and your mother, your only\nprotector, the totality of your interests. No discipline can\nbe stern enough for the man who denies that by word or deed.\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"

    "body_text": "Hi folks, Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask, but I am trying to do on my linux desktop what I used to do with some other os software. I'm trying to use a combination of some bash scripts and some perl to generate reports from a couple of ascii files. Eventually these will run on a server and get the files by ftp, analyse them and mail me the results. As I'm no programmer (by any stretch of the imagination !) I'm getting a bit lost. I can deal with single files (eventually) using grep, egrep, awk, and a nice perl script called 'total' which i found while googling. Problem now is that the data I'm trying to report on is split between two isam files. File 1 contains Docket Number, Line Number, Item, quantity, price, duedate File 2 contains Docket Number, Customer, Shipping date, invoice number. To make some sense of the data, I need to relate the Docket number between the 2 files, so that I can generate a report by customer. My first reaction is to look at mysql, and import the ascii data into 2 tables so that I can use sql queries. Is this the way to go, or should I delve a bit deeper into perl ? Any advice welcome.

Sounds like you're solving the wrong problem. If untrusted strangers are relaying spam through your qmail server, it's a fair bet that you've seriously botched your qmail config (like forgetting to create an rcpthosts file or something). Anyway, if you insist on using razor to resolve this problem, I would suggest tossing qmail-scanner <http://qmail-scanner.sf.net/> and SpamAssassin <http://www.spamassassin.org/> into the mix as well. The former provides the qmail-integration framework on which the latter does its work (including razor-check invocations). Fair warning: It'll be far more resource-intensive than simply denying relaying privileges to everyone except the folks you trust. To find out how to do that, go to <http://www.qmail.org/> (which, incidentally, should be your first stop for all things qmail) and search for \"qmail newbie's guide to relaying\". - Adrian ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: Dice - The leading online job board for high-tech professionals.

Centralized spam fighting takes food out of those coders' mouths! I still think self-add whitelists are underrated. A FoRK whitelist would presumably start with all subscribers, and grow from there.

Wait... I didn't think we had any filters set up on FoRK. Kragen, do you know of any? I personally have FoRK delivered to an address (napier%waste.org) that has SpamAssassin enabled, agressively, where it just nukes anything it thinks is spam. Usually I figure if I miss a FoRK post, no big deal, I'll pick it up by the replies if it's interesting. For personal mail (joe%barrera.org) I either don't use SpamAssassin, or use it but where it just flags messages instead of nuking them. So if someone is sending a message just to me, I'll get it even if it looks like spam. So in other words, Rohit, if you had sent to joe%barrera.org, I guess I would have received it in a timely fashion. So where's all that booze? When's the retry?

Is there any > overriding reason why I should go with the more expensive and > lower-capacity DDS-4 drive other than speed? The ADR (Advanced Digital Recording) tape format is an interesting option, one I hadn't seen much of, before. Look as if OnStream (spun off from Philips Electronics in 1998) invented and rather tightly control the format, though other companies such as Verbatim do make compatible media under licence. If you're reasonably serious about backup, you need to plan for a rotational backup scheme and retirement of tapes as they become worn (and well before they start failing). That requires at least a couple of dozen tapes for the first couple of years. Therefore, cost and availability of media are (or should be) a major factor. Also, tape heads wear out and need to be replaced (more rapidly for helical-scan systems -- which ADR turns out _not_ to be), and somehow that always ends up being cheaper for tape technologies in which there is heavy competition. The less-tangible consideration that comes most immediately to mind is that, if one's OnStream ADR drive fails, the only possible replacement that would suffice to restore your accumulated backup sets is another OnStream ADR drive. In that sense, you're somewhat locked in: I'm not seeing ADR drives from anyone else (though I might have missed them). If OnStream are smart, they've priced the drives to attract people into the system, and are making up the shortfall on media cost after they get people to buy in. I see the following prices for mail order (http://www.finnsoft.com/priclist/verbat.htm) of Verbatim-brand tapes: 42 euros for 30 GB ADR tape 33 euros for 30 GB ADR tape, four-pack. 66 euros for 50 GB ADR tape. 44 euros for 50 GB ADR tape, four-pack. 47 euros for ADR cleaning tape. (You don't get much lower pricing than Verbatim, without going no-name.) Capacities are usually quoted on the basis of a nominal 2:1 compression ratio. The PDF datasheet for Onstream's \"ADR2\" series says this is a linear-serpentine recording technology (a good thing) like DLT, SDLT, and LTO, rather than a helical-scan method typified by DDS/DAT, AIT, and 8mm (which puts heavy wear on tapes on heads). I'm not sure what software other than NovaStor's TapeCopy and Yosemite Technology's Tapeware will support OnStream's drives. My recollection is that BRU will do it. On balance, I'd personally _still_ go with a DDS4 drive using either DDS3 or DDS4 media, mostly because once you've survived life with one oddball, less-standard tape format, you're not in a hurry to repeat the experience. But ADR does seem at a quick glance to be well designed, and might be a good bet after all.

However, this OnStream IDE\n> tape drive - http://web6.scan.co.uk/Products/Info.asp?WPID=14022\n> (thanks for the link, Martin) - by my calculations provides more\n> storage at only slightly slower speeds at half the price. Is there any\n> overriding reason why I should go with the more expensive and\n> lower-capacity DDS-4 drive other than speed?\n\nThe ADR (Advanced Digital Recording) tape format is an interesting\noption, one I hadn't seen much of, before.  Look as if OnStream (spun\noff from Philips Electronics in 1998) invented and rather tightly\ncontrol the format, though other companies such as Verbatim do make\ncompatible media under licence.\n\nIf you're reasonably serious about backup, you need to plan for a\nrotational backup scheme and retirement of tapes as they become worn\n(and well before they start failing).  That requires at least a couple\nof dozen tapes for the first couple of years.  Therefore, cost and\navailability of media are (or should be) a major factor.  Also, tape\nheads wear out and need to be replaced (more rapidly for helical-scan\nsystems -- which ADR turns out _not_ to be), and somehow that always\nends up being cheaper for tape technologies in which there is heavy\ncompetition.\n\nThe less-tangible consideration that comes most immediately to mind is\nthat, if one's OnStream ADR drive fails, the only possible replacement\nthat would suffice to restore your accumulated backup sets is another \nOnStream ADR drive.  In that sense, you're somewhat locked in:  I'm \nnot seeing ADR drives from anyone else (though I might have missed\nthem).  \n\nIf OnStream are smart, they've priced the drives to attract people into\nthe system, and are making up the shortfall on media cost after they \nget people to buy in.   I see the following prices for mail order \n(http://www.finnsoft.com/priclist/verbat.htm) of Verbatim-brand tapes:\n\n42 euros for 30 GB ADR tape\n33 euros for 30 GB ADR tape, four-pack.\n66 euros for 50 GB ADR tape.\n44 euros for 50 GB ADR tape, four-pack.\n47 euros for ADR cleaning tape.\n\n(You don't get much lower pricing than Verbatim, without going no-name.)\n\nCapacities are usually quoted on the basis of a nominal 2:1 compression\nratio.  The PDF datasheet for Onstream's \"ADR2\" series says this is a\nlinear-serpentine recording technology (a good thing) like DLT, SDLT,\nand LTO, rather than a helical-scan method typified by DDS/DAT, AIT, and\n8mm (which puts heavy wear on tapes on heads).\n\nI'm not sure what software other than NovaStor's TapeCopy and Yosemite\nTechnology's Tapeware will support OnStream's drives.  My recollection\nis that BRU will do it.\n\nOn balance, I'd personally _still_ go with a DDS4 drive using either DDS3\nor DDS4 media, mostly because once you've survived life with one\noddball, less-standard tape format, you're not in a hurry to repeat the\nexperience.  But ADR does seem at a quick glance to be well designed,\nand might be a good bet after all.  As they say in the gaming industry,\n\"Ya pays your money, and ya takes your chances.\"\n\n-- \n\"Is it not the beauty of an asynchronous form of discussion that one can go and \nmake cups of tea, floss the cat, fluff the geraniums, open the kitchen window \nand scream out it with operatic force, volume, and decorum, and then return to \nthe vexed glowing letters calmer of mind and soul?\" -- The Cube, forum3000.org\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n"

Subject: [DMCA_Discuss] Security warning draws DMCA threat Date: Wed, 31 Jul 2002 15:04:26 +0400 http://news.com.com/2100-1023-947325.html?tag=fd_top By Declan McCullagh Staff Writer, CNET News.com July 30, 2002, 4:48 PM PT WASHINGTON--Hewlett Packard has found a new club to use to pound researchers who unearth flaws in the company's software: the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Invoking both the controversial 1998 DMCA and computer crime laws, HP has threatened to sue a team of researchers who publicized a vulnerability in the company's Tru64 Unix operating system. In a letter sent on Monday, an HP vice president warned SnoSoft, a loosely organized research collective, that it \"could be fined up to $500,000 and imprisoned for up to five years\" for its role in publishing information on a bug that lets an intruder take over a Tru64 Unix system. HP's dramatic warning appears to be the first time the DMCA has been invoked to stifle research related to computer security. Until now, it's been used by copyright holders to pursue people who distribute computer programs that unlock copyrighted content such as DVDs or encrypted e-books. If HP files suit or persuades the federal government to prosecute, the company could set a precedent that stifles research into computer security flaws, a practice that frequently involves publishing code that demonstrates vulnerabilities. The DMCA restricts code that \"is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing protection\" of copyrighted works. On July 19, a researcher at SnoSoft posted a note to SecurityFocus.com's popular Bugtraq mailing list with a hyperlink to a computer program letting a Tru64 user gain full administrator privileges. The researcher, who goes by the alias \"Phased,\" said in the message: \"Here is the warez, nothing special, but it does the job.\" That public disclosure drew the ire of Kent Ferson, a vice president in HP's Unix systems unit, who alleged in his letter on Monday that the post violated the DMCA and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

Until now,\nit's been used by copyright holders to pursue people who distribute\ncomputer programs that unlock copyrighted content such as DVDs or\nencrypted e-books.\n\nIf HP files suit or persuades the federal government to prosecute, the\ncompany could set a precedent that stifles research into computer\nsecurity flaws, a practice that frequently involves publishing code\nthat demonstrates vulnerabilities. The DMCA restricts code that \"is\nprimarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing\nprotection\" of copyrighted works.\n\nOn July 19, a researcher at SnoSoft posted a note to\nSecurityFocus.com's popular Bugtraq mailing list with a hyperlink to a\ncomputer program letting a Tru64 user gain full administrator\nprivileges. The researcher, who goes by the alias \"Phased,\" said in\nthe message: \"Here is the warez, nothing special, but it does the\njob.\"\n\nThat public disclosure drew the ire of Kent Ferson, a vice president\nin HP's Unix systems unit, who alleged in his letter on Monday that\nthe post violated the DMCA and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\n\n[...]\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n\n------------------------\nhttp://www.anti-dmca.org\n------------------------\n\nDMCA_Discuss mailing list\nDMCA_Discuss@lists.microshaft.org\nhttp://lists.microshaft.org/mailman/listinfo/dmca_discuss\n\n----- End forwarded message -----\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"
