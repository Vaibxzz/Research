    "body_text": "Business project >From Qin Wang Lloyds TSB Pacific Limited Hong Kong Branch Fax: +852-301-66259 Thank you for giving me your time. Please be patient and read my email to you. I am a staff of Lloyds TSB Group attached in Private Banking Services. I am contacting you concerning a customer and, an investment placed under our banks management 3 years ago, I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication and I Would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In 2000, the subject matter; ref: bb/tsb/bank/73 came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services Department. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 8.35 million United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the Private Banking Services Department, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and alternative investments. Based on my advice, we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over 10 million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments. In mid 2001, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Europe. He directed that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm in Europe. I informed him that our bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across borders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9/11. I contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in main land Europe. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and Well- connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was deposited. He told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had, this transpired around 20th June 2002. In June last year, we got a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit, and I could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit. I made futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four days later, information started to trickle in, that he was apparently dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cannes, South of France. We were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; he died in testate. What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose. There is US$ 8,370,000.00 deposited, I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as the finance firm, the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the funds to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process. The finance firm has no single idea of what's the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man's family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal , you share similar details to the late fellow I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half and no more. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50. I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. But on the other hand, you with a similar name as the original depositor would easily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to claim. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a few days. I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the file relating to the customer. I will then officially communicate with the finance company and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as accountholder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the firm. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive or destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by I hope you understand because for once I found myself in total control and face to face with my destiny. These chances won't pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let's share the blessing. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through this email address (qin_wang1@o2.pl) I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man; I happily married with two kids. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences might be, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learned from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, we should plan a meeting, soon. I await your response.

I will then officially communicate with the finance company \nand instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done.\n\nThe alternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as \naccountholder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the \nfirm. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of this \nproposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this \nmail. I ask that you do not be vindictive or destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, \ndelete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do \nnot approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy \nsums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal \nand what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, \nbut the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come \nones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by\n\nI hope you understand because for once I found myself in total control and face to face with \nmy destiny. These chances won't pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you \nwill not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am \na family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a \nreward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks \nand the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am \nthe only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has \nplanted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let's share the blessing.\n\nIf you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to \ninform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about \nthis project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do \nI want you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through this email \naddress (qin_wang1@o2.pl)\n\nI do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines are not secure lines as \nthey are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total \nQuality Management Policy.\n\nPlease observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man; I happily \nmarried with two kids. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the \nconsequences might be, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that \nsuccess and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have \nlearned from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one \naccord, we should plan a meeting, soon.\n\nI await your response.\n\nSincerely,\n\nQin Wang\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfree|access - pripojeni k internetu zdarma na kterem vydelas\nPripoj se k internetu zdarma pres free|access a ziskej vyhody, ktere jinde nedostanes!\n\nwww.freeaccess.cz\n\n\n"

Please accept my sincere apologies.In bringing this message of goodwill to you, I have to say that I have no intention of causing you any pains. My name is SENATOR GBENGA ALUKO, the executive Chairman Pension funds committee in the senate of the federal Republic Of Nigeria. I am writing you to earnestly Solicit your assistance in helping to receive some sum of money. I got your e-mail address on the Internet while searching for a reliable and reputable person to handle this transaction. THE PROPOSITION: We have the sum of US$9,000,000.00 (Nine Million Dollars) that we intend to transfer overseas through the assistance of a foreign partner.This money came as a result of the unclaimed pension funds belonging to a British expatriate petroleum engineer with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,Engr.John Bruno. After all other pensioners have been paid their entitlements, we deposited this unclaimed sum of US$9,000,000.00,with the Debt Reconciliation Committee. In a bid to make sure Engr.John Bruno gets his due,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Engr.John Bruno died, from an automobile accident.On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Engr.John Bruno did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents.This sum of US$9,000,000.00 is still sitting in an account of the Debt Reconciliation Committee and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law,at the expiration of 2 (two) years,the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Engr.John Bruno so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names,address,telephone and fax numbers so that I can prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin to Engr Bruno. Upon this,we would then obtain the letter of probate/administration in your favor from a Federal High Court.A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me and my partners,30% for you and 5% for any expences incured,during the course of this transaction. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done at the high court and my position as the Chairman of the Committee guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.The fund shall be transferred to you legally in accordance to all laid down procedures governing transfer of funds.If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.Please observe utmost confidentiality,and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Justin an Attorney at Law, a South African national practicing here in the UK. I am writing to notify you of the TESTAMENT of one or our Client who unfortunately lost his life in the Madrid bomb blast on March 11, 2004, killing over two hundred people including tourists in Spain. He was a prominent business leader who had been in Spain for vacation with his wife and their only daughter. The deceased who was residing in the United States of America before his death made a deposit of Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$15,500,000.00) in Amsterdam Netherlands, his effort to avoid the obligatory payment of income tax in the United States of America. However, I was mandated by our team of professionals to search for the relatives of the deceased regarding his deposit as the holding financial institution wants him to come forward for the endorsement of the reinvestments documents on interest accrued. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his Next of Kin or relatives to come over to sign the reinvestment documents or claim his deposit because the financial institution cannot release these funds unless a formal application is made which is in line with the Royal Dutch law on inheritance claim. Regrettably, I learnt that his supposed Next of Kin, which could be his spouse or his only daughter died along with him in the ugly Madrid Bomb Blast leaving nobody with the knowledge of this huge deposit except me as the personal lawyer attached to monitor his deposit. It is in this regard that I and my colleagues decided to solicit your assistance by presenting you as the next of kin to the deceased. Although, we have agreed on the following sharing ratios: 25% for your assistance and 75% for me and my colleagues but it is still negotiable. NB: This transaction is very confidential and 100% risk free as I have a copy of his LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT which I can present your name as the TRUSTEE & EXECUTOR. This transaction shall be executed under legitimate and legal procedures that will protect you from any breach of the Law. Therefore, do not hesitate to revert back to me, either via fax or email, with the following details if my proposal interests you: A signed copy of this letter, your address and your telephone and fax numbers.

E-mail olageorge@ukrpost.net Dear Friend, My name is Ola George,General Manager, Corporate and Investment Banking Division(South)with African Continental Bank Plc,Lagos-Nigeria.I came to know about you in my private search for a reliable person/company to handle a confidential transaction on behalf of myself.As a matter of fact, I got your information from the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry/Nigerian Export Promotion Council. l write in respect of a foreign customer with our Bank,who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Union Transport Africaines Flight Boeing 727 which crashed on December 25,2003. Since the death of this our customer , I have kept a close monitoring of the deposit records and accounts since then. Nobody has come forward to claim the money in his A/C as next of kin to the late customer. The total amount in the account is US$12.5 million and it is a domiciliary escrow bank account. Also the funds can only be released to a foreigner. As it stands now, there is nobody in the position to produce the needed information other than my very self-considering my position in the bank.Based on the fact that all the family perished in the same flight accident, leaving no one to put claim of the deposit as the next of kin,so I am seeking for your co-operation to present you as the next of kin, and arrange for the release of the funds to your honour for our mutual benefit. I am willing to share this money with you in the ratio of 70-30%.You shall have 30% of the funds and I shall have the rest (70%) .I hope this is a fair sharing? I look forward to hear from you urgently so that we can proceed accordingly.I wait for your urgent response. Best Regards.

We should always pray for the safety, peace, love and brotherhood for people all over the world. Too bad we can't have an independence day for the entire world. A day of freedom from ignorance, hatred, war, illusions, power and control. A day where we can all love each other as human beings and toss away the weapons of war, and cast out our fears and hatreds from our hearts into the graves. We must mourn the graves of the innocents all over the world, and give the children of the world the hope of a peaceful, loving and beautiful world. A world full of love and without hatred or fear. A world where we can join hands together and accept one another, regardless of our skin color, ethnic divisions, religion or nationality. If we don't unite as a human race, then we have condemned the future generation of children a dark and very grim future. Think of love, compassion and peace always... MY PRAYER FOR PEACE AND HARMONY Merciful God, You made all of the people of the world in Your own image and placed before us the pathway of salvation through different Preachers who claimed to have been Your Saints and Prophets. But, the contradictions (made by us) in the interpretation of Your teachings have resulted in creating divisions, faith based hatreds and bloodshed in the world community.

    "body_text": "Business project >From Mr.Qin Wang Lloyds TSB Pacific Limited Hong Kong Branch Two Exchange Square Central, Hong Kong TEL:852-300-61424 Fax: +852-301-66259 Fax:852-301-77134 http://www.lloydstsb.com.hk Thank you for giving me your time,it is of great importance for you to take care and understand every word which I have written down below; please be patient and read my email. I am a staff of Lloyds TSB Group Plc here in Hong Kong attached in Private Banking Services. I am contacting you concerning a customer and an investment placed under our banks management; as a matter of fact it was 3 years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail private and also to kindly respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this email.I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication; I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In 2000, the subject matter; Ref: FI/TSB/957/048/0532 came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services Department. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 11.37 million United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over (invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the Private Banking Services Department, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed, and however I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and 200 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation, the accrued profit with interest included, stood at this point at over 13.2 million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments. In mid 2001, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Europe. He directed that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm in Europe.I informed him that our bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across borders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9/11. I contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in mainland Europe, I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was deposited; he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had, this transpired around February 25th 2002. In June last year, we got a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit, and I could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit.I made futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four days later, information started to trickle in, that he was apparently dead, a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cannes, South of France; we were soon enough able to gather more information and the cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; he died in testate. In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate, this investigation for several months were futile. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my decision to obtain your contact details and contact you, being as a foreigner or rather non-Asian, as a potential benefactor of the estate even if you are in no way affiliated with this individual (the deceased).My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation. What this means, with you being a foreigner, I have considered the fact that our dear late fellow died with no known or identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the firm will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to our bank, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back to our bank. This will result in the money entering our bank's accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the Private Banking Services Department. This will not happen if I have my way. What I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something; it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios; you should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose. There is USD$ 11,991,674 deposited, I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so.I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as the finance firm is concerned, the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the funds to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process. The finance firm has no single idea of what's the history or nature of the deposit, they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward, and this is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family of the deceased; they have investigated for months and have found no family but however the investigation has come to an end. My proposal; I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half and no more; that is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you; afterwards we share the proceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit, but on the other hand, you as a indifferent foreigner would easily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to claim, I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a few days. I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the file relating to the customer, I will then officially communicate with the finance company and instruct them to release the deposit to you; with these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder, this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the firm. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions, I am aware of the consequences of this proposal and I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask also, that you do not be vindictive or destructive, if my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you; please not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector, I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by and I hope you understand, because for once I found myself in total control and face to face with my destiny. These chances won't pass me by, I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me please let me know, and hence move on with my life, but do not destroy me; I am a family man and this is an occasion to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking, I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank; I am the only one who knows of this situation, good fortune will bless you and plant you into the center of relevance in my life, lets share the blessing. If you find yourself interested to work with me, please contact me specifically, through this email account (wang6qin@yahoo.com.hk), if you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. It is necessary to inform you that under no condition should you contact me via official channels; I will simply deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through our official lines neither do I want you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through this email address above; I do not want any direct link between you and me.My official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management policy, please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man; I happily married with two kids, I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences might be, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold, this is the one truth I have learned from my private banking clients; do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, I shall have the pleasure of meeting you after this task has been completed plan a meeting, soon. I await your response. Yours Sincerely, Qin.",

I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this\nmail private and also to kindly respect the integrity of the information\nyou come by as a result of this email.I contacted you independently of our\ninvestigation and no one is informed of this communication; I would like\nto intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to\nyou.\n\nIn 2000, the subject matter; Ref: FI/TSB/957/048/0532 came to our bank to\nengage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services\nDepartment. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 11.37\nmillion United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over\n(invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I made\nnumerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief\noperations officer of the Private Banking Services Department, especially\ngiven the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on\nnumerous occasions prior to any investments being placed, and however I\nencouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The\nfavored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on\n600 traditional stocks and bond managers and 200 managers of alternative\ninvestments. Based on my advice, we spun the money around various\nopportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of\noperation, the accrued profit with interest included, stood at this point\nat over 13.2 million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full\npotential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on\ninvestments. In mid 2001, he asked that the money be liquidated because he\nneeded to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Europe. He\ndirected that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm in\nEurope.I informed him that our bank would have to make special\narrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process,\nthe bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for\nbanking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later\ncame around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was\nasking of us. Cash movement across borders has become especially strict\nsince the incidents of 9/11.\n\nI contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in mainland\nEurope, I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise\ninstructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security\nconsultancy firm, the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts\ndeposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that\nhandle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate\naccess to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar\nespecially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line\nwith instructions, the money was deposited; he told me he wanted the money\nthere in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was\nthe last communication we had, this transpired around February 25th 2002.\nIn June last year, we got a call from the security firm informing us of\nthe inactivity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding\nposition as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the\nprivate banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit, and\nI could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit.I\nmade futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of\nlocating him to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four\ndays later, information started to trickle in, that he was apparently\ndead, a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart\nattack in Cannes, South of France; we were soon enough able to gather more\ninformation and the cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately\nlaunched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert\nabout the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you\nare familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our\nservices usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from\nconventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In\nthe field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will\nknow of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors\nuse numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives\nthe choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the\nbank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I\nsaid, rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart\nfrom not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in\nour care, in this case; he died in testate.\n\nIn line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed\naway, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who\nshould have right to claim the estate, this investigation for several\nmonths were futile. We have scanned every continent and used our private\ninvestigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is\nthis investigation that resulted in my decision to obtain your contact\ndetails and contact you, being as a foreigner or rather non-Asian, as a\npotential benefactor of the estate even if you are in no way affiliated\nwith this individual (the deceased).My official capacity dictates that I\nam the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to\nreceive the results of the investigation. What this means, with you being\na foreigner, I have considered the fact that our dear late fellow died\nwith no known or identifiable family member.\n\nThis leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the\nprevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late\nbeneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the firm will by the\nend of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to\nour bank, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert\nthe deposit back to our bank. This will result in the money entering our\nbank's accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out\nof the Private Banking Services Department. This will not happen if I have\nmy way.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice but I\nwant you to understand something; it is only an outsider to the banking\nworld who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational.\nThe world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for\nthose who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios; you\nshould have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I\npropose. There is USD$ 11,991,674 deposited, I alone have the deposit\ndetails and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them\nto do so.I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as the\nfinance firm is concerned, the transaction with our deceased customer\nconcluded when I sent the funds to the firm, all outstanding interactions\nin relation to the file are just customer services and due process. The\nfinance firm has no single idea of what's the history or nature of the\ndeposit, they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to\nany party that comes forward, and this is the situation.\n\nThis bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family of\nthe deceased; they have investigated for months and have found no family\nbut however the investigation has come to an end. My proposal; I am\nprepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm to\nrelease the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt\nof the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half and no\nmore; that is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them\nrelease the deposit to you; afterwards we share the proceeds 50/50.I would\nhave gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have\ndrawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit,\nbut on the other hand, you as a indifferent foreigner would easily pass as\nthe beneficiary with the rights to claim, I assure you that I could have\nthe deposit released to you in a few days. I will simply inform our bank\nof the final closing of the file relating to the customer, I will then\nofficially communicate with the finance company and instruct them to\nrelease the deposit to you; with these two things: all is done. The\nalternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another\nbank with you as account holder, this way there will be no need for you to\nthink of receiving the money from the firm.\n\nWe can fine-tune this based on our interactions, I am aware of the\nconsequences of this proposal and I ask that if you find no interest in\nthis project that you should discard this mail. I ask also, that you do\nnot be vindictive or destructive, if my offer is of no appeal to you,\ndelete this message and forget I ever contacted you; please not destroy my\ncareer because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this\nbut people like me who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations\nrun the whole private banking sector, I am not a criminal and what I do, I\ndo not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to\nunderstand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this\nmove. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot\nlet this chance pass me by and I hope you understand, because for once I\nfound myself in total control and face to face with my destiny.\n\nThese chances won't pass me by, I ask that you do not destroy my chance,\nif you will not work with me please let me know, and hence move on with my\nlife, but do not destroy me; I am a family man and this is an occasion to\nprovide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project\nand it is a task well worth undertaking, I have evaluated the risks and\nthe only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and\nalerting my bank; I am the only one who knows of this situation, good\nfortune will bless you and plant you into the center of relevance in my\nlife, lets share the blessing.\n\nIf you find yourself interested to work with me, please contact me\nspecifically, through this email account (wang6qin@yahoo.com.hk), if you\ngive me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a\nconclusion. It is necessary to inform you that under no condition should\nyou contact me via official channels; I will simply deny knowing you and\nabout this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through our\nofficial lines neither do I want you contacting me through my official\nemail account. Contact me only through this email address above; I do not\nwant any direct link between you and me.My official lines are not secure\nlines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer\ncare in line with our Total Quality Management policy, please observe this\ninstruction religiously.\n\nPlease, again, note I am a family man; I happily married with two kids, I\nsend you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the\nconsequences might be, but I know within me that nothing ventured is\nnothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter\nof gold, this is the one truth I have learned from my private banking\nclients; do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, I shall\nhave the pleasure of meeting you after this task has been completed plan a\nmeeting, soon.\n\nI await your response.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nQin.\n\n\n"

I, on behalf of my other colleagues from different Federal Government of Nigeria owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as regards the transfer of the above stated amount into your bank account. This fund arose from the overinvoiced of various contracts awarded in my parastatal to certain foreign contractors sometime ago. We as holders of sensitive positions in our various parastatal, weremandated by the federal government to scrutinise all payments made to foreign contractors, and discovered that some of the contracts they executed were grossly over invoiced, either by omission or commission. Also, we discovered that the sum of $33,000,000.00(thirty three million American dollars only) was lying in a suspense account, although the foreign contractors were fully paid their entitlements after executing the said contracts. We all agreed that the over-invoiced amount be transferred into a bank account provided by a foreign partner, as the code of conduct of federal civil service does not allow us to operate foreign accounts. However, we have suceeded in transferring some of the monies, precisely US$7.5(Seven million five Hundred American Dollars) into a foreign account in Morocco (North Africa), but unfortunately the provider of the account has severed all forms of communication with us as he has refused to adhere to our earlier mutual agreement, insisting tha the total amount be paid into his nominated bank account before disbursement will take effect. We are therefore seeking your assistance based on the balance amount US$25.5M which can be speedily processed and fullyremitted into your nominated bank account. On successful remittance of the funds into your account, you will be compensated with 20% of the amount for your assistance and services. This transaction is closely knitted and in view of our sensitivepositions we cannot afford a slip.

In any case,I am left with no option but to contact you in this manner. my decision to write to you was informed by knowledge that being established personally that you could be disposed to understand my predicament in order to give me the assistance I require I am Frank Siaka the son of a late Sierra-Leonian businessman, late Dr.Coleman Siaka the owner of (RMS) Mining Company in Sierra-Leone, who died few years ago when the Revolutionary United Front Rebels (R.U.F) attacked our residence on the 11 of Feb. 2004 in Makeni Sierra-Leone. Following the cease fire agreement which was reached last year with the help of United Nation peace keeping troops, I used the opportunity to leave the country with a very important document of (US$ 7,650,000.00) Seven Million Six Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars, deposited by my late father in Security Company in South Africa, under my name. This money was realized from diamond export, now I and my mother are seeking asylum in South Africa under (UNHCR). I contacted you because of the need to deal with person whom my family and I have no previous personal relationships, and I confirmed your country as being economic conducive for investment and her people as transparent and trust-worthy to engage in business, hence my reason for writing you however, this money in question has been in the security company since his death. But my main problem now is that at my age of 28yrs, I am confused on how to handle this huge amount of money and also what to do with it as I don't have anyone to confide in South Africa here. May I use this medium to request from you if you will be disposed enough to help me keep this huge amount in your country or any other place of your choice that will have more security to the money and the life of me and my family? I have met the security company with the depositional documents that my father left behind, of which my name appears as the \"Next Of Kin, the company awaits my coming for the withdrawal, and I am even afraid of disclosing the content to them since my father in his letter had warned me against that. If it appeals to you to help me, I will suggest you take a trip to South Africa for us to meet face to face and finalize before moving the fund or if there is any other means you can suggest for the transferring of the fund to your very position pending my arrival to meet with you for investing of the money with any profitable business you introduce, as I have decided to do away with Africa entirely. I want immediate confirmation of your through our e-mail address. As soon as I get your response I shall give out more details on how we shall proceed. Kindly keep this proposal strictly confidential because of our present status here in South Africa. Thanks and remain blessed. I wait to receive a favorable response from you urgently.

On April 6 2000 the military forces loyal to the Government of Ahmed TIJAN KABBAH invaded the Diamond and Gold mine and assassinated my husband, mistaking him for his brother MIKE LAMINE who is the deputy to the leader of the revolutionary United Front (RUF ) FODAY SANKOH. When the news reached me, I hurried gathered some valuables in our family villa and escaped for my dear life in the company of my only son PETERS. Among the valuables was a file that contained details of a Deposit my husband made in a security company in Europe. He deposited US$ 15.5 M contained in 1 Trunk Box in the name of our son PETERS as containing family valuables. He did not disclose the real contents of the box to the security company. Rather, he declared the deposit as Family Valuables for security reasons. This is the money he made from the sale of Gold and diamonds during his time as the General overseer. We need your sincere assistance to move this funds out from the security company IN EUROPE for investment in your country as we cannot invest here due to its nearess to our country and the war still going on there.

    "body_text": "Dear Sir, I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek for foreign assistance in a business. It is with heartfelt hope that I write to seek your co-operation and assistance in the context stated below: May I first introduce my self: I am Dr.(Mrs.) MARIAM ABACHA, the wife of Late General Sani Abacha (former Military head of state and President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria) who died suddenly on 8th June 1998. I got your contact on the internet as I was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children, hence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband. I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. Having noted the confidence reposed on your person , I became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving the sum of US$8 Million secretly willed in my favour by the late general (my husband). This money was kept in a Security Company in Amsterdam Holland and I have all documents with me as of when it was deposited in a Security Vault for safe keeping. This money has been defaced for Security reasons and also to avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons. it is not an ill gotten wealth rather, it was generated from my organisation \"FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAM\" (F.S.P). I will enlighten you more of this organisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf. On your acceptance to render this assistance to me to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for non-speculative investments in your country.However,the current civilian administration of retired General Olusegun Obasanjo(The President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria) is seeking vengeance on the Abacha family because of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late husband while in office. In pursuit of this vendetta, the present Government have resolved to freeze all known assets of General Sani Abacha including properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the various bank accounts of my husband in Swizerland,UK,Australia. In fact, the attack on our family (The Abacha's) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our travelling passport ,family accounts and even trying some members of our family in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband. In view of this grievous threat to our Economic and personal survival, our family trustee have secretly protected the will ,The Security Company has called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the demurrage it is incurring and I told them we would come and claim it very soon. but my son seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas accuount, hence the reason why I have chosen you and hope that you will come to my full assistance and unlimited co-operation. In the meantime, there is a travelling embargo on us(the whole family members) and our local accounts are seized. We are currently living on goodwill of people who believe we annot be held responsible for the sins of my late husband. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my children from a hopeless future. And if you agree to help, we will compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25% of the total amount of $8 Million US Dollars. In that case,when the money ($8 Million) is moved into your discrete account, you will be allowed to withdraw 25% in your favour ,while 10% has been set aside for any expenses you might incur or tax as your government may require . The remaining 65% will be invested meaningfully for my children's future. My cousin (Dr.yemi musa) has perfected arrangements with the Trust Company concerned and has been assured 100% risk free and safe operation. What I demand from you now is to arrange to visit the Finance Company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona-fide owner. And in due course, all contacts must be made through cousin Dr yemi musa whom is presently staying in Senegal through this E-mail: ma23200210@zipmail.com.br and ma232002@box.az and phone:+221-5478858.I look forward to your quick response while thanking you for your co-operation.

Direct Telephone; +44-703-189-3319 Direct Fax; +44-700-594-2286 Good Day Dear, My name is JONATHAN WRIGHT, Principal Partner in CASTLE Law Chambers, London,UK. I was formally a personal attorney to Mr. Mohammed Saibi who was the chairman of Algosaibi Diving and marine Services in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Mr. Saibi died late last year of heart attack at the ripe age of 79 years. Mr. Mohammed Saibi a Saudi Arabia Philanthropist, before he died, made a Will in my law firm stating that $3.2M (Three million, Two Hundred Thousand U.S. dollars only) should be donated to any charity home of our choice overseas as his last contribution to humanity when it became obvious that he will not stay alive for too long. His only son, Rasheed Saibi and his entire family has no knowledge of this. However, I am very much aware that he has left enough wealth that will last his generation a lifetime. The true situation at the moment is that the said amount of money was deposited with the BANK here in UK only to be paid out to a charity home.The charity home/organization would have to be picked by my law office. This implies that you will stand as the beneficiary to this Will so that the funds could be processed and transferred to your account if you are ready and in a position to assist me. You do not need to have a charity organization, all you need do is to declare your interest and show seriousness. As a professional lawyer, I have mapped out strategies which I will use to obtain all the proper/legal documentations and last approval from Ministry of Finance concerning the funds which I will send the copies across to you for your perusal and record puppose before the bank will contact you. I am particularly interested in securing this money from the Bank because they have issued a notice instructing us to produce the beneficiary of this Will as soon as possible, else the account would be made dormant since Mr. Saibi was ill for a long period of time before his demise.If you are interested in assisting me, I will give you 30% of the entire funds after paying taxes due to your government and expenses incurred during the course of this transaction. The balance will be mine although I intend to send some of it to a charity organization. I urge you to contact me immediately for further details if you are satisfied with my proposition and feel you are in a position to assist me. Bearing in mind the confidential nature of this transaction. For the trust I have on you, I believe that you have the ability to handle this transaction, I will Prefer you respond through this particular mail or call me on my direct phone indicated above. Yours faithfully, BARR.JONATHAN WRIGHT Esq. FOR:CASTLE LAW CHAMBERS.",

I was formally a personal attorney to Mr. Mohammed Saibi who\n was the chairman of Algosaibi Diving and marine Services in Dhahran,\n Saudi Arabia. Mr. Saibi died late last year of heart attack at the ripe\n age of 79 years.\n\nMr. Mohammed Saibi a Saudi Arabia Philanthropist, before he died, made\n a Will in my law firm stating that $3.2M (Three million, Two Hundred\n Thousand U.S. dollars only) should be donated to any charity home of our\n choice overseas as his last contribution to humanity when it became\n obvious that he will not stay alive for too long. His only son, Rasheed\n Saibi and his entire family has no knowledge of this.\n\nHowever, I am very much aware that he has left enough wealth that will\n last his generation a lifetime. The true situation at the moment is\n that the said amount of money was deposited with the BANK here in UK only\n to be paid out to a charity home.The charity home/organization would\n have to be picked by my law office. This implies that you will stand as\n the beneficiary to this Will so that the funds could be processed and\n transferred to your account if you are ready and in a position to assist\n me. You do not need to have a charity organization, all you need do is\n to declare your interest and show seriousness.\n\nAs a professional lawyer, I have mapped out strategies which I will use\n to obtain all the proper/legal documentations and last approval from\n Ministry of Finance concerning the funds which I will send the copies\n across to you for your perusal and record puppose before the bank will\n contact you.\n\nI am particularly interested in securing this money from the Bank\n because they have issued a notice instructing us to produce the beneficiary\n of this Will as soon as possible, else the account would be made\n dormant since Mr. Saibi was ill for a long period of time before his\n demise.If you are interested in assisting me, I will give you 30% of the entire\n funds after paying taxes due to your government and expenses incurred\n during the course of this transaction. The balance will be mine\n although I intend to send some of it to a charity organization.\n\nI urge you to contact me immediately for further details if you are\n satisfied with my proposition and feel you are in a position to assist me.\n Bearing in mind the confidential nature of this transaction.\n\nFor the trust I have on you, I believe that you have the ability to\n handle this transaction, I will Prefer you respond through this particular\n mail or call me on my direct phone indicated above.\n\nYours faithfully,\nBARR.JONATHAN WRIGHT Esq.\nFOR:CASTLE LAW CHAMBERS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "body_text": "To err is human they say and to forgive is divine; but how do you start to forgive the killers of your younger brother if you do not know who the faceless persons are and if you are still living in fear of them? I am Mike, Simba Rossman's son; I'm a student at the University of Cape Town in South Africa where my two brothers and I were schooling; In line with the prevailing festive seasons, I feel it is not out of order to wish you and yours a happy festive season and God's blessings and abundance in this year. My younger brother was was pushed in front of an oncoming train that crushed the life out of his young body. We know he was murdered because my other brother and I have also had attempts made on our lives twice now and we have told our father about it. Kindly allow me digress a little bit, I am not telling you all of this to scare you please, I made my mind over and decided to write to you after having given much thought to our situation; My Father Dr. Simba Rossman, was the former Minister of Finance and Economic Development in Zimbabwe under the Government of Mugabe, his so called policies were not too popular with the other zombie-like cronies of our so-called president who openly questioned his loyalty to Mugabe. That was when the problems all started, he got death threats from people we did not know but suspected to be party loyalists, his car was burnt on one occasion when we were on a visit in Zimbabwe last year. The police did not even bother trying to investigate the matter; Mugabe finally removed him for openly and honestly declaring to the world that Zimbabwe faced a major and crippling food crisis at the height of the state-sponsored illegal land invasions. My younger brother varnished from our flat in Cape Town one afternoon and his body was found drugged and battered and all through his life he never smoked a stick of cigarette, not even a stimulant. It was obvious that die-hard supporters of Mugabe murdered him to spite or break my father's spirit, for my father loved him the most like we did. This brings me back to why I write you; I write to solicit for your help. My father was a successful businessman before he was called to serve in Mugabe's cabinet and he had business interests all over Africa, over here in South Africa our family has US$14.7 Million held in trust on our behalf by a Holden Agency, this was made possible by our father years ago with the help of his advisor who runs a finance company based here in South Africa. According to my father, the deposit was not made in his name but in the name of a company that was registered by him and leaving room for another partner with 82% controlling shares in the business; then the business was registered both in South Africa and in Zimbabwe, so that no one can claim that he was the owner of the money. My father cannot travel down to South Africa as he is being watched by agents of the state back home, he consulted with his advisor who is in South Africa and came up with this idea to help claim the funds and ferry my brother and I out of South Africa to a place of relative safety like the United States or England where we can continue with either schooling or working. If you decide to assist us, you will be required to discuss with us on Tel:2773 268 8646: we has been authorized by our father to open discussions with you if you signify your interest in assisting us. I can also be contacted on my via e-mail address Currently, my brother and I are living in South Africa and after deliberating with our father, he sees no need for us to return to Zimbabwe. Please note that by your offering to assist us we will on your contacting us by phone or Fax, discuss a suitable compensation for you and also I would like to mention too that this transaction must be conducted within a legal framework as we have our father's good name to protect and another major thing I demand from you is an honest answer if you have handled any transaction of this kind of magnitude before and assurance from you that our family has your complete trust and assurance that the funds will be safe once transferred to your account. We thought that the recent elections in Zimbabwe would maybe oust Mugabe and give us new hope to go back, but the outcome of it has left us with a stronger resolve NEVER to go back to Zimbabwe again.So you see that we are really in dire need of assistance to begin our lives anywhere away from Zimbabwe. Please assist us. Yours Sincerely, Mike Rossman. __________________________________________________________________ Switch to Netscape Internet Service.

I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. An American Gold Consultant/Contractor with the South African Solid Gold Corporation, Mr. Glenn Hatleberg made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$20,000,000.00 (Twenty Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South African Solid Gold Corporation that Glenn Hatleberg died in a plane crash in Alaska Airlines Flight #261 (for more information about this crash and person, you can contact this website: http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ Since we got this information about his death on further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of Kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Glenn Hatleberg did not declare any Kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Republic of South Africa, at the expiration of 6 (SIX) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Glenn Hatleberg so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of Kin. We shall employ the services of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of Probate/Administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the Beneficiary/next of Kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you, then 10% will be mapped out for any expenses that we may incur during transactions. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private Fax and Phone numbers below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. And kindly observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

PHONE CONTACT 00226.78.89.77.34 DEAR FRIEND, I know you may be surprise to recieve this e-mail ; I got your contact address from the internet while I was searching for my friend that has similar name with you. I am the manager of bill and exchange BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) at foreign remittance department. There is a business I would want you to champion for me, in my department I discovered an abandoned sum of ($31.500.000 U.S) thirty one million five hundred thousands US dollars) In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on 25TH JULY, 2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [Flight AF4590] with the whole passengers aboard. The name of the deceased man was (MR.ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich Germany) N.B. In other for you to believe me honestly, visit the web site to enable you know whether we can work together, below is the website. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm You have to understand that I come crossed this huge amount of money when I was arranging the departmental customers file to submit to the bank management for the annual audit of the year. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin's or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I dont want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after some years, the money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkina citizen cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant (A Banker), we are not allowed to operate any foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in the same bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account. I dont want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill, I agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60 % would be for me. There after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted. All modalities of this transaction have been carefully worked out and once started will not take more than fourteen (14) working days, with your full support. This transaction is 100% risk free. it involve no any implication and no any precaution there after. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter reply to thi box. at; Trusting to hear from you immediately.

I am Mr. John Taylor, the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my Bank. In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of US$8.5M,(Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his wife and only daughter in a plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261 which crashed on 31 January, 2000. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this site http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/ The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great industrialist and a resident of Alaska. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and for our bank to release the money to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will send to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after 6 years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than 5 years and I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money has been transfered to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you only that will know that the money is not transfered into our treasure. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Senegalese cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering you 30% of the total sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other charges) likely to be incurred during the course of transaction, while the remaining 65% is for me. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for this money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thomson. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail through the above email for further directives. Yours Faithfully, Mr. John Taylor.",

My name is Barrister Philip Ajayi a lawyer to the Ex - President Charles Taylor, the president of liberia . During the rebellion in my client's country, my client deposited Twenty-Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$28.5M) with a security company in Lome, Togo which was part of the money meant for his campaign for re-election into office. Presently, the fund has long been moved diplomatically to a Financial Vault Company in Europe where it is still kept in safe custody. MY REQUEST As a result of my client's present situation as a refugee in Nigeria who cannot have access to own an account or accounts, I am looking for a trustworthy individual/ firm by my client's instructions to receiving the funds and advicing us in making the rightful investment as well as to provide account(s)where the funds will be lodged into. More also, we are at the interim interested in buying properties for residence as my family will be residing there in the near future. COMMISSION/REMUNERATION As regards your commission/remuneration, my client have decided to offer you 15% of the total sum and also set aside 5% for all your expenses (i.e telephone bills, travelling expenses, hotel bills and other miscellaneous expenses). I strongly believe that associating with you to embark on this and other business ventures will derive a huge success hereafter and it will be a long lasting business association via my email for further briefing. Endeavor to send your full contact details like your full names, address, telephone and fax numbers. As soon as I receive the above information, I will let you have the contact details of the security company in Europe where funds are deposited to enable you verify the existance of the security company and the deposited funds before we proceed on this transaction.

I am Mr. Nicholas Kular, the son of late Mr. JOHNSON KULAR, who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. Kindly work with me to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you, my late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority. Before his death, he had earlier taken to South Africa the sum of US$ 26.5 Million (Twenty -Six Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which he deposited with a Security Company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited in a box as VALUABLES AND PERSONAL EFFECTS to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was for purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the \"modus operandi\" adopted by the government. This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs. Precisely, More than thirty-eight (38) people have so far been killed. Heads of governments from the west, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe'splan. Subsequently, South African Development Community (S.A.D.C) has continuously supported Mugabe's new land act, it is against this background that I and my family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father's money into a foreign account. As the eldest son of my Father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our family wealth and South Africa's government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history. More so, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an \"ASYLUM\". As a business person whom I entrusted my future and that of my family into his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk-free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter. For your assistance, we are offering you 20% of the total sum, 75% for me and my family while 5% will be mapped out for any expenses we may be incured during the course of this transaction. We wish to invest our part of the money on commercial property based on your advice. Finally, all i want from you is assurance that you will not betray my trust. If this appeal is acceptable to you, please confirm your interest via the above telephone number or better still email. Best Regards. Mr.Nicholas Kular (For the Family).",

With due respect, I am Mr. SHAKIR ABDUL,the director in charge of audit and accounts unit,foreign remittance dept.of the AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB),TANZANIA IN EAST AFRICA. I decided to contact you for a beneficial and risk-free business transaction. During our auditing and investigations in this bank,my department came across the sum of (US$35,000,000.00) THIRTY-FIVE-MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY, belonging to an international business man who died along with his family on the 31st October 1999 in a plane crash, in an Egyptian airline ( Egypt- Air) 990 - with other passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below which was published by CNN.WEBSITE.http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/03/21/ntsb.egypt.air/index.html OR www.theatlantic.com/doc/prem/200111/langewiesche . Before our discovery of this development, there was no trace of claim from any person as the fund remains dormant in his account with this bank. Although I keep this information secret whitin my jurisdiction to enable us put claims and transfer the said amount through a trustworthy friend overseas whom we shall indirectly present to the bank as the bonafide next-of-kin to the deceased for a profitable and successful transaction - Because after five years the money will be called back to the bank's treasury account as unclaimed bills and the money shared amongst the directors of the bank. So it is on this note that i decided to seek for a foreign assistance whom his name shall be used as the next of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to share this money amongst them at the end of the year. Meanwhile, all the arrangments/documents to put claims as the bonafide next-of-kin to the deceased,to get the required approval and transfer of this money to a foreign account has been put in place.The directives and the needed informations will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to cooperate fully.Infact, we could have done this alone but because as civil servants we are not legally allowed to operate foreign account in our country and it would eventually raise an eyebrow on our side during the time of transfer because we are staffs of the bank.These are the actual reasons why it requires a second-fellow who will forward claims by our indirect support as the bonafide next-of-kin.And also present a foreign bank account (Old or New account)where the money will be transfered into. On conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 25% of the total sum as gratification, 5% of the total sum will be set aside for contingency,while 70% will be for me and my partners here. Please you have been advised to keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account,We then come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to the percentages indicated above, and for investment purpose like in any country you may as well advise us professionally on how to invest the money. All other necessary informations will be sent to you when i receive an email response from you or a telephone call. Pls. You can mail me anytime via the above email address for confidential purpose. Expecting your urgent response. Yours Sincerely, SHAKIR ABDUL.",

So it is \non this note that i decided to seek for a foreign assistance whom his \nname shall be \nused as the next of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to\nshare this money amongst them at the end of the year.\n\nMeanwhile, all the arrangments/documents to put claims as the bonafide \nnext-of-kin to the deceased,to get the required approval and transfer \nof\nthis money to a foreign account has been put in place.The directives \nand\nthe needed informations will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate \nyour\ninterest and willingness to cooperate fully.Infact, we could have done\nthis alone but because as civil servants we are not legally allowed to \noperate foreign account in our country and it would eventually raise \nan eyebrow on our side during the time of transfer because we are \nstaffs of the bank.These are the actual reasons why it requires a \nsecond-fellow who will forward claims by our indirect support\nas the bonafide next-of-kin.And also present a foreign bank account\n(Old or New account)where the money will be transfered into.\n\nOn conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 25% of the \ntotal sum as gratification, 5% of the total sum will be set aside for \ncontingency,while 70% will be for me and my partners here.\nPlease you have been advised to keep top secret as we are still in \nservice and intend to retire from service after we conclude this with \nyou.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until \nyou confirm the money in your account,We then come down to your country\nfor subsequent sharing of the fund according to the percentages \nindicated above, and for investment purpose like in any country you \nmay as well advise us professionally on how to invest the money.\nAll other necessary informations will be sent to you when i receive \nan email response from you or a telephone call.\n\nPls. You can mail me anytime via the above email address for \nconfidential purpose.\n\nExpecting your urgent response.   \n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nSHAKIR ABDUL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "body_text": "ECONOMIC RECOVERY COMMITTEE, FEDERAL SECRETARIAT, LAGOS-NIGERIA. Dear Sir, BUSINESS PROPOSAL: TRANSFER OF US$19.2 M (NINETEEN MILLION, TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) & BUSINESS INVESTMENTS PARTNERSHIP. First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of it's nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to us in confidence through the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce, foreign trade division. and if the contents of this mail does meet with your approval, i humbly crave your indulgence. I am the chairman of the Economic Recovery Committe (ERC) set up by the present civilian Government of Nigeria to review economic policies of government parastatals, and find out ways to reduce waste and maximise revenues allocated to them. In the course of our work at the ERC, we discovered this fund which resulted from gross re-valuation of contracts by top government officials of the federal ministry of Aviation (FMA). The company that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$19.2 Million lying unclaimed in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria. Upon interogation of the directors of engineering and finance, who both happens to be my contemporaries in the university, they confessed to me in confidence that they had an agreement with the original contractor to re-value the original contract by 30%. This 30% which amounts to USD19.2m was to be their share from the contract, since the original contractor was well disposed towards giving them the conventional 10% kickback. When I now asked them what they intended to do now that my committee has discovered this USD19.2M. They begged me not to disclose this information to the government as they will likely lose their jobs and their family names destroyed. I was at at a crossroad, as I did not want my friends to suffer for what other top government officials do and get away with. I discussed with the other two members of my committee and we all unanimously agreed to transfer this fund out and share amongst ourselves. I have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the committee to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US$19.2M legally sub-contracting the entitlement to you/your company. This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign company or running foreign account while in government service hence the need for a foreign partner. Should this transaction interest you, you are to contact me on my personal e-mail address, so that I can brief you fully, and discuss your renumeration for this undertaking. All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information: Your full name/ company name, address, company's details & activities, telephone & fax numbers. These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers in America, Asia and Europe is going to be made out in your name. Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my personal E-mail address. Yours Faithfully Abayomi Davies.",

I am Mr. Ali Raza Khan, currently Head of Coporate affairs with a reputable bank here in U. A. E. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. jack farrer powell made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003,as his account officer and as well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned undelivered. After sometime, I tried sending back the letter,but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr.jack farrer powell died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. On further investigation, I discovered that Mr. jack farrer powell family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any WILL.This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have heard from the owner since 2003.I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have made so far, my bank management is not aware of it, I am the only one that have the information. With the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By end of this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of above $5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not for terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the country immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source of the money. I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance. As the Account Officer to late jack farrer powell , coupled with my present position and status in the bank as Head of Retail Banking Groug , I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you. All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes. If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality . I shall send you copy of his last statement of account issued to Al Nasser when the deposit was made for your perusal. I wait your urgent response soon. Regards, Mr. Ali Raza Khan.",

My investigations prove to me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and has no attachment to the said amount. The amount involved is 56 MILLION USD (FIFTY-SIX MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) ONLY. In the light of the fact, I needed your assistance to open your door to this opportunity by providing your account or any account of your choice where the fund will be remitted. I want to transfer this money into a safe foreigners account abroad but I dont know any one who could actually assist, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can only be approved to a foreign account because the money is in US Dollars and the owner of the account ENGR.

I am married to a contractor here  who happened to loose his life in the war zone because he is opposed to the rebel group. Since the death of my husband and my 15 year old daughter things have not been thesame. We managed to get ourselves in the Chavakachcheri division of Jaffna peninsula where we have been in a camp with more or less to eat and drink. I have been making some arrangement to leave here with my son and relocate to another country but it is not easy because i have no money with me. I have a consignment which contains cash and other valuables that my late husband always told me about that he deposited in a security firm in Europe which i will require your assistance to get so that i could make haste and  leave this war torn zone. I really need the content of this consignment because for you to get out of here safely you have to pay heavy money to the rebels so that they will guide you safely to a safe zone and i have nothing on me to do that that is why i contacted you to assist me get the consignment so that i could make arrangements to leave this place. At the moment my only means of communication is through my late husband's laptop which i have with me here {because there is free internet connection around here} as we do not have access to telephone and are afriad of leaving this camp because of constant shelling and fighting outside. Please i will like you to assist me to have a safe and better life and also for many more others that are here whom i want to help get out of here too. I will inform you more when i hear from you.

Attention Please, I am Musa Garuba, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction . During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development. The said amount was U.S$ 22.85M ( Twenty two million, eighty five thousand United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account. I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have been adviced to keep \"Top Secret\" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when I hear from you. I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication, Yours faithfully, Musa Garuba. _________________________________________________________________ Testez Windows Live Mail Beta ! http://www.ideas.live.com/",

    "body_text": "Hello my dear I wish to solicit your kind and urgent assistance.My name is Mr.PATRICK AGOLO, a lawyer based in Lagos State of Nigeria.As a lawyer, I was a private legal adviser (for almost two decades) to a white couple who unfortunately lost their lives 3-months ago in a ghastly motor accident here in Nigeria. Prior to their death, this white couple had lived in this country since the 1960?s as missionaries and educationists. Unfortunately, they died childless, with no knownrelatives or next of kin. The issue at stake, for which I am writing you now, is that the deceased left behind the sum of US$7.8million in their joint account with ECO INTERNATIONAL BANK Nigeria Incorporated. Soon after the burial of the deceased, I had promptly notified the bank,which is awaiting me to present to them the person that is to inherit the account of the deceased. Incidentally, as I said before, the late couple had no known next of kin or relatives. No one else knows about this.However, it will amount to abuse of privilege for me to lay claim to the wealth and estate of the deceased, since as a black man i couldn't have been their relative. But then funds can't be left to the bank permanently/forever. So I have decided to contact you, to seek your consent to present your name to the bank as the next of kin and the appointed administrator/inheritor of the estates of the deceased. As a whiteman, you'll fit into the picture.As the lawyer to the deceased, no body can disbelieve me if i present you as the next of kin to the deceased. Moreover, I know the exact legal requirements and documents to secure in your favour to show proof that you are actually the next of kin/inheritor of everything left behind by the deceased. All these will be my responsibility to obtain from the court here in Nigeria. You won?t be needed here in person. I can assure you that this is my specialty and there is nothing for you to be afraid of. I will handle and provide for all that it will take legally.Once everything needful is done, the bank will be satisfied to transfer the monies from the account of the deceased to yours. My interest is to take 60% of the funds while you take 30%, while the remaining 10% will be disbursed to any Orphanage-Home of our common choice.Please communicate your decision to me urgently, indicating your Telephone number in your reply so that I can call you and talk this thing over with you.

Goodday Dear, I know this mail will come to you as a surprise,nevertheless I am Mrs. Lydia Johnson, aged 59 years, the wife of Major stephen johnson, Chief Security Officer and Aide-de\\ufffdcamp to the exiled president Charles Tailor of Liberia . As a result of the on-going problem in my country, I am saddled with problems of my ill-health of protracted diabetes and high blood pressure which is getting of increase in the recent times, more importantly getting a trust worthy individual abroad to receive the sum of US$7million on our behalf. Due to this war crises presently in my city Monrovia our home town, I managed to sneak myself and my son David 23 years of age and four other of my daughters out of Monrovia to Dakar senegal for safety. We were sneaked into Dakar Senegal through the land boarder by the help of some government militant group. After the killing of my husband by the rebels, we decided to come down here to Dakar senegal to secure the deposit in a finance firm by my husband and to further look for a trust worthy individual abroad to receive these deposit which has being deposited here in Dakar Senegal before he was eventually killed by the heartless rebels. I feel confident therefore to introduce myself to you based on this problem and our present condition as all our foreign contacts and connections got lost during this crises, all properties burnt by the rebels. I am desperately in need to move and re-locate this huge deposit to your country for safe keeping as this is the only wealth remaining for the future survival and well being of my large family. For your percentage for assistance, a negotiable percentage will be discussed as soon as I receive your response based on this plea for your assistance as our lives are highly in danger due to this problem. I pray and plead for your help. You can email me back for further clarifications God bless you as you respond to my plea for assistance. Sincerely yours. Mrs Lydia Johnson.",

    "body_text": "CONTACT ME THROUGH MY ATTORNEYS FAX; 234-1-7591936 OR EMAIL Compliments of the day to you! I am Mrs. Mariam Abacha widow of the late General Sanni Abacha former Nigerian Military President who died on active Government service on june 8, 1998. I got your contact from the Internet and I do believe you can help me. I am contacting you due to the present situation as regards the undemocratic manner the present administration in my country (Nigeria) is taking all that belongs to us You may be aware that this is the usual attitude of leaders especially in Africa when there is a change of Government. The present Government of General Olusegun Obasanjo is currently in a face off with my family in his bid to recover all our money because my Husband is dead. They have brought up charges of corrupt enrichmemnt against us. Unfortunately, he is currently facing same from the National Assembly right now. I pray he does not get an Impeachment The law they made is yet another smear campaign aimed mainly to frustrate, humiliate, dismember and widen the scope of hatred for my family. A personal vendetta by President Obasanjo who was jailed by my husband's Government for plotting a coup d 'etat against his administration in 1995. This highly calculated attempt by this administration plus some Western Banks through bi-lateral relationship has taken away from us a whopping amount in Switzerland and Bank accounts around the World. This rampaging of our Bank accounts abroad have yielded to the barbaric pressure and just few months ago we were squized out of another US$395m because the accounts bear our names. This assertions can be ascertained independently if you wish to confirm this from a leading newspaper in Nigeria (This Day Newspapers) from their website at www.thisdayonline.com from the archives section in the March 10,2001, January 26,2002 and March 18, 2002 editions. This pressure is taking a great toll on my family and all we ever owe. You may be aware that my surviving eldest son (Mohammed), was undully detained without trial untill thursday 11TH of July 2002 one year now that the Supreme Court of Nigeria Ordered his release and cleared him of any wrong doing as he has been languishing in prison for the past three and half years. It was on Monday 23RD September last year that he was finally released to us. Please we wish to solicit your cooperation as a foreigner to help us receive some family property / (Money) Deposited with a Security company which is our only hope / source of livelihood for now. This is a call for you to help receive this money and put the money into good investments since we are barred from leaving the Country for now. According to my estimation in Western Europe and America alone we still have over US$70M in cash with Security Companies that we intend to put in your care by getting a trusted foreigner to handle money for the purpose of investment and safekeeping abroad. Please Note that you will be expected to deal directly with the security company with the information and LEGAL POWER we shall give you to handle the entire transaction. There is demurrage accrued over time payable to Security Company to enable collection of the Consignment, since the Deposit we made at the time of Deposit has since expired. You must also know that CONSIGNMENT WAS DEPOSITED AS FAMILY TREASURES, ACTUAL CONTENT ON CONSIGNMENT WAS NOT DECLARED TO SECURITY COMPANY AT THE TIME OF DEPOSIT TO SAFE GUARD IT. If you can do this, contact my ATTORNEY, BARRISTER ALI KOLOMA Fax; 234-1-7591936 as you will be well REWARDED. This is however subject to our negotiation and agreement. You can contact me ONLY via our family Attorney, Barrister Ali Koloma, BY email: palmgroovechambers@winningteam.com for security reason and further details. Endeavor to keep this highly confidential. In your response include your private telephone / fax numbers for easy communications with him.

    "original_text": "CONTACT ME THROUGH MY ATTORNEYS FAX; 234-1-7591936 OR EMAIL\n\nCompliments of the day to you!\n\nI am Mrs. Mariam Abacha widow of the late General Sanni Abacha\nformer Nigerian Military President who died on active Government\nservice on june 8, 1998.\n\nI got your contact from the Internet and I do believe you can\nhelp me.\n\nI am contacting you due to the present situation as regards the\nundemocratic manner the present administration in my country\n(Nigeria) is taking all that belongs to us You may be aware\nthat this is the usual attitude of leaders especially in Africa\nwhen there is a change of Government. The present Government of\nGeneral Olusegun Obasanjo is currently in a face off with my\nfamily in his bid to recover all our money because my Husband is\ndead.\n\nThey have brought up charges of corrupt enrichmemnt against us.\nUnfortunately, he is currently facing same from the National\nAssembly right now. I pray he does not get an Impeachment The\nlaw they made is yet another smear campaign aimed mainly to\nfrustrate, humiliate, dismember and widen the scope of hatred for\nmy family. A personal vendetta by President Obasanjo who was\njailed by my husband's Government for plotting a coup d 'etat\nagainst his administration in 1995.\n\n\nThis highly calculated attempt by this administration plus some\nWestern Banks through bi-lateral relationship has taken away from\nus a whopping amount in Switzerland and Bank accounts around the\nWorld. This rampaging of our Bank accounts abroad have yielded to\nthe barbaric pressure and just few months ago we were squized\nout of another US$395m because the accounts bear our names. This\nassertions can be ascertained independently if you wish to\nconfirm this from a leading newspaper in Nigeria (This Day Newspapers) from\ntheir website at www.thisdayonline.com from the archives section in the\nMarch 10,2001, January 26,2002 and March 18, 2002 editions.\n\nThis pressure is taking a great toll on my family and all we ever\nowe. You may be aware that my surviving eldest son (Mohammed),\nwas undully detained without trial untill thursday 11TH of July\n2002 one year now that the Supreme Court of Nigeria Ordered his\nrelease and cleared him of any wrong doing as he has been\nlanguishing in prison for the past three and half years. It was on Monday\n23RD September last year that he was finally released to us.\n\nPlease we wish to solicit your cooperation as a foreigner to help\nus receive some family property / (Money) Deposited with a\nSecurity company which is our only hope / source of livelihood\nfor now. This is a call for you to help receive this money and\nput the money into good investments since we are barred from\nleaving the Country for now.\n\nAccording to my estimation in Western Europe and America alone we\nstill have over US$70M in cash with Security Companies that we\nintend to put in your care by getting a trusted foreigner to\nhandle money for the purpose of investment and safekeeping abroad.\n\nPlease Note that you will be expected to deal directly with the\nsecurity company with the information and LEGAL POWER we shall\ngive you to handle the entire transaction. There is demurrage\naccrued over time payable to Security Company to enable\ncollection of the Consignment, since the Deposit we made at the\ntime of Deposit has since expired. You must also know that CONSIGNMENT WAS\nDEPOSITED AS FAMILY TREASURES, ACTUAL CONTENT ON CONSIGNMENT WAS NOT DECLARED\nTO SECURITY COMPANY AT THE TIME OF DEPOSIT TO SAFE GUARD IT. If you can\ndo this, contact my ATTORNEY, BARRISTER ALI KOLOMA Fax; 234-1-7591936 as\nyou will be well REWARDED. This is however subject to our negotiation and\nagreement.\n\nYou can contact me ONLY via our family Attorney, Barrister Ali\nKoloma, BY email: palmgroovechambers@winningteam.com for security reason and further\n details.\n\nEndeavor to keep this highly confidential. In your response\ninclude your private telephone / fax numbers for easy\ncommunications with him.\n\nMy kind regards,\n\nMrs. Mariam Abacha\n(PLEASE REPLY ONLY TO; my Attorneys FAX NUMBER; 234-1-7591936, OR\n email;palmgroovechambers@winningteam.com)\n\nDISCLAIMER:This e-mail message and any attachments are\nconfidential and may be privileged or otherwise protected by\nlegal rules, and for use by the addressee only.

Actually, I got your mailbox in the web while trying to get a good and capable business person in your country for both business and investment purposes.Let me start by introducing myself; I am Barrister Frank Michelle (Esq) I was the Personal Attorney to late Mr. Morris Thompson an American who was a private businessman in my country unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31st 2000, including his wife and only daughter. You can read more about the crash on visiting these sites below, 1. http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list 2. http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html Before the plane crash, Mr. Morris Thompson made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months with a value of US$ 2,500,000.00 (TWO MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATE DOLLARS) in a bank here in U.K. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, another notification was sent and still no response came from him. I later found out that Mr. Morris Thompson and his family had been killed in that plane crash. After further investigation it was also discovered that Mr. Morris Thompson's next of kin was his daughter who died with him in the crash. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration of 5 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the U.K. GOVERNMENT, if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thompson so that you will be able to receive these funds for both of us. WHAT IS TO BE DONE:- I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successfully. As a barrister, I will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thompson. PLEASE YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE YOUR FULL INFORMATION SUCH AS STATED BELOW, [1] NAME: [2] ADDRESS: [3] AGE: [4] SEX: [5] TELEPHONE: [6] FAX: [7] OCCUPATION STATUS: Also be informed that this Transaction will take us just 15 working days to accomplish beginning from when I receive your Data's.After you have been made the next of kin, I will also file an application to the bank on your behalf as soon as I secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the movement of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. This process is 100% risk free as I have set out all the modalities to see that a legalized method is used because then I will prepare all the necessary documents. Please note that utmost secrecy and confidentiality is required at all times during this transaction. Once the funds have been transferred into your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 50% for me, 45% for you and 5% set aside for any incidental expenses incurred during this transaction.

    "body_text": "JOHANNESBURG REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA E-MAIL; williamzungu@hotmail.com Attention: President C.E.O URGENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE I know you will be surprised to hear from me since you dont know me personally. I am WILLIAM ZUNGU , the son of Dr. ZUNGU who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through your countrys Information Exchange in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves a transfer of fund into a foreign account and I decided to write to you. The war veterans of the ruling Government of President Robert Mugabe for their alleged support murdered my late father among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers in cold blood for the Movement of Democratic Change (MDC), which is against Mugabes rule. The land problem arose when Mugabe introduced a New Land Act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some blacks vehemently condemned the modus operadi adopted by the government. This resulted to rampart killings and mob action by the war veterans and thugs. More than 78 people have so far been killed. Heads of Government from the West, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabes Land Act. Subsequently, South Africa Development Community (SADC) has continuously supported Mugabe. It is against this background that my family and I who are currently in South Africa have decided to transfer this money out of Africa as we no longer feel safe anymore and want to transfer this money to a foreign country where we can establish ourselves. Just before my fathers death, he took me to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of US$30.0000.00 (THIRTY MILION UNITED STATE DOLLARS) with a security and finance company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the finance company. This amount was embarking for the purchase of new farms machinery and chemicals, as well as the establishment of some new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking for genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred into without knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our familys wealth and the South African government seems to be playing along. I am faced with the dilemma of investing the money here since both countries have almost the same history. More so, the South African Foreign Exchange does not allow such investments as I am seeking for asylum. As a businessperson whom I have to entrust my future and that of my family, I must let you know that there is no risk and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter. Therefore, should you be able and willing to help me and my family, we are willing to offer you 30% of the total sum for your assistance, 10% will be set aside for expenses we may incur while the rest 60% will be for my family. It is our wish to invest our money on commercial property based on your advice and I will also receive assurance that you would not sit on this money when transferred into your account. If this proposal is acceptable by you, please confirm your interest via my EMAIL.please i want you to include your private telephone number for easy communication.

Please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the Democratic Republic of Congo and one of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace. Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. We were then given this money privately by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other Cabinet Members. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary. WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a security company in Europe in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from our lack of trust of our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information We gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality. We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this fund in Europe. This is because we are under restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in order not to lose this fund which we have worked so hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out of Congo, you can contact me through my email addresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us. Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's Security is Guaranteed if we follow the required guidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as soon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist us. I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response. Thank you and God Bless. Best Regards COL. MICHAEL BUNDU(RTD). mikebundu@rediffmail.com N\\\\B.

Before his death he made a vow to use his wealth for the down trodden and the less privileged in the society.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of \u00a31 Million (One Million Pounds sterling) in a Vault with a Security company in JAPAN. Presently, this money is still there. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next 30 days due to cancer problem.Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to an individual or better still a God fearing person who will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct . I want an individual that will use this fund and provide succor to poor and indigent persons, orphanages, and above all those affected in the Tsunami in far Asia.and you I understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not inclined to helping poor persons and I do not want my husbands hard earned money to be misused or spent in the manner in which my late husband did not specify. I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going.

    "body_text": "This is a Brand New Compnay Never Marketed Before. We have seen these types move 4.00 in the first day of marketing. We Expect the 6th to be unbelieveable. THIS IS A SOLID COMPANY. PETROSUN DRILLING (PSUD) Current Price: 1.30 Up .05 Friday without any marketing! Current News PetroSun Announces Formation of Algae BioFuels PetroSun Drilling Inc. (PSUD - News), an emerging provider of oilfield services to major and independent producers of oil and natural gas, announced today that the company has formed Algae BioFuels Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary. Algae BioFuels will be engaged in the research and development of algae cultivation as an energy source in the production of biodiesel, an economically feasible and eco-friendly alternative to petroleum-based transportation fuels. The R&D and production facilities for Algae BioFuels will be based in Arizona and Australia. \"PetroSun's formation of Algae BioFuels is a forward-looking strategy,\" said L. Rayfield Wright, president of PetroSun. \"The 0pp0rtunity to produce a renewable energy product that will assist in providing a healthier planet for future generations cannot be ignored.\" Biofuel is any fuel that is derived from biomass -- which contains recently living organisms or their metabolic byproducts. Biofuel is a renewable energy source, unlike other natural resources such as petroleum, coal and nuclear fuels. Agricultural products specifically grown for use as biofuels include corn and soybeans. Extensive research is currently being conducted to determine the utilization of microalgae as an energy source, with applications being developed for biodiesel, ethanol, methanol, methane and even hydrogen. Independent studies have demonstrated that algae is capable of producing 30 times more oil per acre than the current crops now utilized for the production of biofuels. Algae biofuel contains no sulfur, is non-toxic and highly biodegradable. The Office of Fuels Development, a division of the Department of Energy, funded a program from 1978 through 1996 under the National Renewable Energy Laboratory known as the \"Aquatic Species Program.\" The focus of this program was to investigate high-oil algae that could be grown specifically for the purpose of wide-scale biodiesel production. Some species of algae are ideally suited to biodiesel production due to their high oil content, in excess of 50%, and extremely rapid growth rates. One of the biggest advantages of biodiesel, compared to many other alternative transportation fuels, is that it can be used in existing diesel engines, which relieves automotive manufacturers of having to make costly engine modifications. Biodiesel can also be mixed, at any ratio, with conventional petroleum diesel. As a result, the alternative fuel can be used in the current distribution infrastructure, replacing petroleum diesel either wholly, or as a diesel fuel blend with minimal integration costs. About PetroSun PetroSun's current operations are concentrated in the Ark-La-Tex region with plans to expand into New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Australia in 2006. PetroSun provides a comprehensive array of products and services to the oil industry. The company's cutting-edge technologies, combined with a proven ability to apply them effectively and safely within a disciplined ROI framework, creates long-term value for PetroSun shareholders and partners. PetroSun is headquartered in Phoenix.",

Good Day I NEED YOUR HELP PLEASE This may appear a bit surprising to you but very beneficial as a matter of urgentcy,I am desparately looking for a foriegn partner whom i can trust to handle some investment or fund movement.I am Mrs.GLORIA DUBE,wife of late Mr.PETER DUBE,who was murdered by the Zimbabwean veterans and irrate blackpeople.I am writing from South Africa.I got your address from the internet through the consultancy directory during my search for a reliable and honest person to transact this business with. I write to solicit for your special assistance to a family shattered by a tyrannical government led by a dictator and his(ZANU-PF)ruling party-president Robert Mugabe.Because of land and farm land crisis in Zimbabwe,the government secretly sponsored the war veterans and some irrate party members to disposess the land being occupied by white farmers.This action has led to the killing of some members of opposition party including my husband(Mr.PETER DUBE). But before the death of my husband,he anticipated some dangers and so he deposited the sum of US$15.4m(Fifteen million four hundered Thousand United States Dollars)in the name of our only son JAMES DUBE,with the help of reputable security company in south Africa with the intention of using it to open fertilizer manufacturing company among other companies in our neighbouring country(Swaziland)after his university education. On the 29th of June 2000,the war veterans and some supporters of(ZANU-PF)ruling party trooped into our compound and axed him(my husband)to death.Since then,they have been terrorizing my only son,JAMES DUBE,but we managed to escape to a neighbouring country,South Africa as a political asylum seeker(refugee).But our position in South Africa does not permit us to open an account or run any huge financial business. That is why I want this fund to be transferred into your private account so that you will assist him to invest it in your country.Hence,if you agree to assist us,we will offer you 20% of the money for your assistance,80% will be for our family investment in your country through your assistance.I need your urgent and confidential response.Please you can contact my son JAMES DUBE Email him atjamesdube000@webmail.co.za Best regards, Mrs.GLORIA DUBE.

    "body_text": "Dear Friend, This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. I am Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN, currently Head of Corporate affairs with a reputable bank here in Dubai -U. A. E. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003, as his account officer and as well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned undelivered. After sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. On further investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nassers family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any WILL. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have heard from the owner since 2003. I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have made so far, my bank management is not aware of it, I am the only one that have the information. With the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By end of this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of above $5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not for terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the country immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source of the money. I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance. As the Account Officer to late Al Nasser, coupled with my present position and status in the bank as Head of Retail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you. All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes. If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when the deposit was made for your perusal. I wait your urgent reply through my private emailaddress: Regards, Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN. ================================================================= Ikuti lomba Puisi Online dan Desain Kartu Elektronik Keterangan lebih lanjut, silakan buka http://www.plasa.com/ =================================================================",

I am writing this letter to you to intimate you of a pending transaction I want to execute with you privately. Anyway I got your contact through one of the Internet Reference Directories in my Chambers. One of my valued clients - Mr. Antonio Montoya died together with his lovely wife Late Antonio Montoya died on the Flight 11, a Boeing 767-200, which was enroute to Los Angeles from Boston during the terrorist attack on America back in 2001. I was his personal lawyer and the Executor of his Will. There are no further traces of any of his next-of-kin in his native Country. As his personal lawyer and Executor of his Will, I know late Antonio Montoya kept about GBP 9.2 million in the Vaults of a bank here in London. This money had been taken to the bank late on the evening of his departure to USA; hence the money was only accepted and registered by the bank while it was kept in the Vault waiting for Montoya's return, which was never to be. I have since confirmed with the bank that the money is still in the bank's vault. Ever since 2001 this money has been in this account untouched! Now, how do you come in and what is your business with all this? I am sure this is the question you would be asking me? Simple, As the personal lawyer to late Antonio Montoya and since vital document relating to this money is kept with my Chambers, I decided that I intimate you of this development, with your co-operation, I can present you to bank as the Next-of-Kin to the late Antonio Montoya. After proper verification of this Claim by the bank this money will be transferred to your bank account hence you come in as the Next-of-Kin to late Antonio Montoya. How do we do it? The document showing that this money is kept in the bank's vault is kept in my Law Chambers. I, as the lawyer and Executor of late Antonio Montoya's Will/Last Testament will put your name in this Will as the Beneficiary of this money kept in the bank's vault. I will submit the Will/Last Testament to the Bank to contact you and start processing transfer of this money to your bank account according to the last wishes of my Client - late Mr. Montoya for further administration to other members of the family. I am the Executor of late Montoya's Will. All I need to do is to re-make the late Mr. Montoya's Will/Last Testament to include your name as the beneficiary and submit same to the bank and introduce you, the bank writes you to confirm this, then transfer process starts without delays. I am the Executor of this Will and the Bank knows it too. The mode of sharing this money will be discussed when we agree to work together on this transaction. What do you think about this? While I look forward to hearing from you soon, absolute confidentiality and secrecy remain very important in this transaction. Thank you and God bless you. Barrister Gareth Jones.",

The document showing that this money is kept in the bank's vault is kept in my Law Chambers. \r\n\r\nI, as the lawyer and Executor of late Antonio Montoya's Will/Last Testament will put your name in this Will as the Beneficiary of this money kept in the bank's vault. \r\n\r\nI will submit the Will/Last Testament to the Bank to contact you and start processing transfer of this money to your bank account according to the last wishes of my Client - late Mr. Montoya for further administration to other members of the family.\r\n\r\n I am the Executor of late Montoya's Will. All I need to do is to re-make the late Mr. Montoya's Will/Last Testament to include your name as the beneficiary and submit same to the bank and introduce you, the bank writes you to confirm this, then transfer process starts without delays.\r\n\r\nI am the Executor of this Will and the Bank knows it too. The mode of sharing this money will be discussed when we agree to work together on this transaction. What do you think about this?  While I look forward to hearing from you soon, absolute confidentiality and secrecy remain very important in this transaction. \r\n\r\nThank you and God bless you.    \r\n\r\nBarrister Gareth Jones. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\n"

WILLIAMS BANIGO FEDERAL SECRETARIAT, LAGOS, NIGERIA Email: banigo@caramail.com URGENT & CONFIDENTIAL Best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as contained in this letter.Before going into details of my proposal to you, I must first solicit you to treat it with utmost confidentiality, as this is required for its success. My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal Government of Nigerias Contracts Review Panel who are interested in diverting some funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the Central Bank of Nigeria.In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said floating funds. We are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this financial quarter. The source of the funds are as follows: During the last military regime, government officials awarded contracts that were grossly over-invoiced to Contractors.The present civilian government set up the Contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel, to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts. My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes. However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of this panel,we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of U.S.$16,500,000.00(sixteen Million,five hundred thousand U.S. Dollars). That is why I am writing you this letter. We have agreed to share the money to be transferred into your account, if you agree with our proposition as follows; (i) 10% to the account owner (you). (ii) 80% for us (the panel officials). (iii) 10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both you and us )incidental to the actualisation of this project. We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other business till we are ready and able to have access to them. Please note that this transactionis 100% safe and risk-free.We intend to effect the transfer within a few days from the date of receipt of the following information: Your name, companys name, address and telephone and fax numbers, and your banking information. The above information will enable us write letters of claim andjob description respectively. This way, we will use your companys name to apply for the payment and backdate the award of the contract to your company. We are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter and, I will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when I hear from you. Best regards, Dr. Williams Banigo Pls.

Union Bank Of China, 99 Queens Road Central Hong Kong, Dear Friend, I write you in good faith, hoping that you will treat this letter as a desperate search for assistance in a matter that shall benefit both of us. A random search based on your locality from the Internet produced your address, Please i apologise for this medium of contact as it appears the only definate way i can have assistance with this matter. I am Mr Eric Wong, Head of Private Banking, Union Bank Of China,also account Manager to a deceased Immigrant property magnate who was based in the U.K. and had vast business interest in Hong Kong ,also referred to as my client. On Monday, 31 July, 2000, 13:22 GMT 14:22 UK , my client, his wife and their two Children died in the Air France concord plane crash bound for New York in their plan for a world cruise I have been managing his Bank accounts here in the Hong Kong, and some Properties which he had put out for sale. The properties which have long been put out on sale have been paid for, and the money paid has long been deposited into his local bank account here. I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and estate left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by my Bank. Particularly, the bank has issued me with a notice to provide any of his next of kin or have the account confiscated within a short period of time.My late client has an account is valued at 18 Million United States Dollars Only I therefore made further investigation,with the personel department and discovered that did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$18million is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Hong Kong, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

But all the same, I believe we do not need to be of blood relatives before we can establish cordial/business relationship. Having said this,I think it is very important at this juncture to introduce myself to you. I am Mr.Wiilams Terry , Head: Enterprise Wide Risk and member of the executive and risk committees of Commecial Bant of Senegal.I got your information while browsing through internet in search of a reliable person who will assist me.This is an urgent and very confidential business proposition. On June 7, 2000,a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Senegal Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Mr.Kurt Kahle made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$10,500, 000.00,(Ten Million, five hundred thousand Dollars). Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his Private Business School. employers, that On the 31st of July 2000, our client, with his 37-year-old wife and his son Michael, aged eight died in the Air France concord plane crash bound for New York in their plan for a world cruise, with other passengers abroad as you can confirm it yourself via the website below: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a \"WILL\",and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Mr.Kurt Kahle did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$10,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it.According to Senegal Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Kurt Kahle so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials.I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you will be able to claim them with the help of my attorney.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address and upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country.

I feel quite safe and satisfy dealing with you in this charity project.Though, this medium (Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the fastest, surest and most secured medium of communication. However, this correspondence is purely private, and it should be treated as such. As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is MR.HARRY HILAL,in the region of U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer . It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS $12,000,000,that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.

I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction . During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development. The said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity. In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account. I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have been adviced to keep \"Top Secret\" as I am still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in.

    "body_text": "My Dear Friend, My name is Dr. Ben Mboye, a Uganda national. I was the Permanent Secretary of Defense & Accounting Officer in Uganda. One of my reasons for contacting you is to share my joy with you that I have been exonerated and cleared by Hon Justice Julie Sebuntinde from the probe that involves three junk Chopper Helicopter purchased from Russia. My second reason is to ask you about the possibility of investing in your country that I believe we can embark upon together. Due to the strong campaign by President Yowery Museveni to subdue the rebel forces of Joseph Kony in my country, directive was given in 1997 for the need to purchase some fresh arms and ammunitions abroad, which includes 3 MI-24 Chopper Helicopter Gunship that have night vision and anti-missile devices from Russian. When my superiors in authority concluded the negotiation for the purchases, I was told to prepare a ?contract? for the purchases of the Helicopters, which I did as the Permanent Secretary of Defence and Accounting Officer. It will amaze you to hear that after the Belarusian suppliers delivered the three MI-24 Helicopters to Uganda, inspection was carried out and it was discovered that the three MI-24 helicopters were junks. Further investigation revealed that Lt. Gen. Salim Saleh who is a younger brother to the President and his Aide-de-Camp (Mr. Ruyondo) connived with the Russian company to supply helicopter that are almost out of service (junks) and they were not overhauled for selfish financial gains. When Hon Justice Julie Sebuntinde probed the case, a report was released stating that The Chief of Logistics and Engineering, The Minister of State for Defence and myself have been exonerated and cleared from the offence. Nevertheless, I lost my job and was prohibited from participating in public services. PLEASE NOTE: In my long years of service to my country, I was able to acquire valuable fixed assets and substantial amount of money. Why the probing of the case was going on, I was advised by my Lawyer to sell off all my acquired properties that worth million of American dollars and also to withdraw my money from my bank account to save them from being frozen and confiscated. Due to the necessity for to lie low, I delegated power to my closest aide Mr. Steve Charles to be in charge of my projects. The money realized from the sales of my properties was added to the money that was withdrawn from my account and the total amount was US$15,500,000.00 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Since I could not lodge this fund into any bank account for fear of being traced, the money was packaged and deposited with a Security Company that belong to a German national, based in South Africa for safekeeping. The funds are security coded and well packaged in a sealed luggage to prevent them from knowing the content. Arrangement is going on for the money to be moved from its current location to an affiliate security company in Europe by Mr. Steve Charles who is currently in europe to transact this business with you since I want my identity to be kept out of the money. What I want from you at this moment is to indicate your interest and willingness to receive this money for investment purposes in your country. You are going to work hand-in-hand with Mr. Steve Charles whom is to represent my interest in this transaction, He is currently in europe. As soon as you receive this email, you are advised to contact him on his email address: stvchar1@netscape.net .He will let you know the modalities to claim the funds and also give you his phone number when you contact him. You will assist me in the investment of this money, but I will not want my identity revealed. I will also want to buy properties and stocks in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments with your assistance. At this point, I want to emphasise the high level of confidentiality, which this business demands and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence that I repose on you. l will render you 25% of this money and 5% will go for other expenses. . You ca n also reach me true Mr Steve Charles As you already know, time is of great essence in this transaction, kindly confirm your telephone and fax number to Mr. Steve Charles. Bear in mind that this project can be concluded within five days if you are prompt in your response. Kind personal regards, DR. BEN MBOYE.",

Dear Friend I am Jun Cheng a manager of bills/exchange at the foreign remittance department of Hanivitbank. In my department, we discovered an abandoned sum of $44,700,000.00 (Forty Four Million, Seven Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only) in an account that belonged to one Late Mr Andrew Phillips an American, who died along with his entire family, on November 1996, in a ghastly plane crash. Since we got the information about his death, we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and file a claim as next of kin over his money because we can not release it unless somebody applied for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately, nobody has come forward to claim this money. It is based on this that some officials in my department and I have decided to establish a cordial business relationship with you, hence by contacting you. We want you to present yourself as the next of kin to Late Mr Andrew Phillips, so that the funds can be remitted into your account. Moreover, we do not want the money to go into the government account as unclaimed bills. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that any account abandoned or is dormant for a period of years, is deemed closed and all money contained therein forfeited to the government treasury account. Now, it is being speculated that the above sum will be transferred into the government account as an unclaimed fund on or before the end of this financial quarter of 2004, when nobody come forward to lay claims. The reason for requesting your assistance, is occasioned by, the fact that the deceased (Late Mr Andrew Phillips) was a foreigner, and we have access to his detailed bio data which you will hold as a weapon to present yourself as the next of kin to Late Mr Andrew Phillips. The mode of sharing after a successful transfer of the money into your account, shall be 70% to my colleagues and I, for the role you will be expected to play in this deal, we have agreed to give you 25% of the total sum and 5% for the expenses we are going to encounter by the two parties in the course of this transaction. Therefore,you are expected to reply this letter indicating your readiness and interest to participate in this business. After receiving your reply, you will be communicated to with the exact steps to take. I expect your urgent response and I shall contact you for further discussion on this matter,to enable us conclude this transaction urgently without any delay or hitch.

I am a staff of CITIBANK NA, LAGOS-NIGERIA in Africa with our head office in USA. I work in the operations dept where I serve as account officer to numerous customers. One of the customers whom I worked as his account officer was a wealthy diamond merchandise. He lost his family, a wife and two children in a plane crash. Because this man was good to me when he was alive, I took it upon myself last month, to search if I could locate any of his close relations. But my efforts were abortive so I did not present any official report of my findings to the bank. Now there are two things I could do with regards to the dead mans money. First, as his accounts officer, I could formally notify the bank authorities that the man is dead and has no next of kin. In this case the money would be forfeited to the government treasury. As a matter of fact this is the proper thing I am supposed to do. Another thing I can do is to arrange for someone else, a foreigner, to act as the next of kin to the late man so that he will claim the money. This is the option that I can do to help anybody and myself since the money actually is now a public fund due to the fact that my friend was a close ally to the late brutal military president that looted government treasury and that is why I have chosen to do it. I want you to be my partner in this deal. I will be investing most of my share into real estate business. All you would have to do is act as the next of kin of the dead man and the whole money in the account will be transferred to your account after due process. As the accounts officer to the late man, I have certificate of the deposit of the fund here our custody and I will also through a local attorney that I will hire, secure all the necessary documents that will empower you legally to claim the money from the account. The funds will be paid to you as inheritance money. The total deposit made in the account is USD10.5 million. We shall discuss and agree further on the percentage sharing ratio for both of us and this will be drafted and seal with an agreement letter on black and white that will bind both of us and guarantee our shares. Note that upon completion of the legal paper work that will make the deal legitimate for you to claim the money as the next of Kin here, the final transfer will be made to your authorize bank account through our correspondent bank in America (CITIBANK FSB MIAMI FOLRIDA or CITIBANK LONDON). All the approved documents and the wiring instructions will be fax to you for your documentation and to enable you approach your bank for confirmation. If you found this proposal worthy enough to benefit, please furnish me urgently with the followings to enable us apply officially for the claim immediately. (1) YOUR FULL NAMES AND ADDRESS.

    "body_text": "Mr. Adam Winpoe. Bojanala House, 90 Protea Road, Chislehurston, Johannesburg 2196. South Africa. Email: adamwinpoe@web-mail.com.ar Kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to you. Although we have never met before but I have every reason to believe that you are a highly respected personality, considering the fact that I sourced your profile from a human resource profile database on your country. Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile political situation in Liberia but it has formed insistent headlines in the CNN, BBC news bulletins, My name is Mr. Adam Winpoe from Liberia, a Country in West Africa. My Uncle is MR JOHN Y. WINPOE, former DEPUTY MINISTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY in LIBERIA. My uncle was falsely accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA (CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him. You can verify this from your country. You can also check in some of the international newspapers posted in the web sites below: http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-07-15- Liberia_x.htmhttp://www.unwire.org/UNWire/20030716/449_6621.asp Before he was killed, my uncle instructed me to escape with his family to a hide out in JOHANNESBOURG SOUTH AFRICA, and he confined on me that he left some money in a Diplomatic Trust Company in Abroad, (name withheld for security reasons) he handed me over a certificate meant for a secret Deposit, which he made in the Security Company. If you may ask why do I need a foreign assistance or why can't I take the cash transfer and myself? The answer is that there was an exclusion clause in the original agreement between the company and my uncle which states unambiguously that 'nobody, not even himself, can have access to the consignment in the company, and it has to be transferred to a foreign beneficiary outside Africa. This was done because he envisaged his arrest and this clause were inserted to prevent any seizure or infiltration of the fund. My decision to contact you is therefore, informed by this and due to my present social status and total ignorance of the business world. I believe you will appreciate the enormity of trust I repose on you by placing the fortunes of our family in your care. Permit me to request that you should reassure me that you would not let me down in any way. On my part, this is my assurance and guarantee to you. In as much as you follow my instructions carefully, religiously and promptly my guarantee of a hitch-free success remains unshakable. I have contacted the Diplomatic Security Firm to confirm the deposit, which is worth $21.5Million,(Twenty-One Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars Only) which I presumed my uncle made from the purchase of arms and ammunitions for the Liberia Army. You will be given 20% of the total sum at the end of the transaction. If you will be willing to assist us claim the money and invest it in your country. I want to assure you that all modalities are in place and it is a risk free transaction. Kindly confirm in your reply if you can come over to enable us conclude this transaction. Kindly include your Private Telephone and Fax numbers where you can always be reach, Your Residential or Company Address to enable me send some other important information across to you. This proposal is highly restricted and should be handled as an urgent transaction requiring trust and Confidentiality. Thanks while looking forward to hearing from you urgently. Thank you. Sincerely, Mr. Adam Winpoe For the Family. ___________________________________________________________________________ Mail sent from WebMail service at - http://www.ca-vn.net",

Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $9.8Million (NINE Million Eight hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with one Bank in London Presently, this money is still with the Bank. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to keep this fund in the Bank I want an organization or an individual that will use this fund for orphanages, widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that grivet. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband&#8217;s efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall inform the Bank in London that you are the beneficiary of the said fund in London . I will also issue you an authority letter that will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the organization to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to receive your reply and Remain blessed in the Lord. Yours in Christ, Mrs. Susan John GREETINGS FROM MRS SUSAN JOHN",

    "body_text": "Standard Trust Bank, 15, Adeola odeku Street, Victoria Island, Lagos. 24th July, 2003 Alternative email address: randebe@cote.azur.fr Dear Friend I am Fadaka Randebe, Bank Official of Standard Trust Bank of Nigeria , Adeola Odeku Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6 1998, a gold merchant/contractor with the Randgold Exploration Company, Mr. Jim Smith made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Randgold Exploration company Ltd that Mr. Jim Smith died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Jim Smith did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it. According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Jim Smith so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. I would also like you to scan you drivers license for me. We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch official guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via my alternative email address. Thanks and regards, Fadaka Randebe.",

    "original_text": "Standard Trust Bank,\n15, Adeola odeku Street,\nVictoria Island,\nLagos.\n24th July, 2003\n\nAlternative email address: randebe@cote.azur.fr\n\nDear Friend \n\nI am Fadaka Randebe, Bank Official of Standard Trust Bank of\nNigeria , Adeola Odeku Branch. I have urgent and very\nconfidential business proposition for you. On June 6\n1998, a gold merchant/contractor with the \nRandgold Exploration Company, Mr. Jim Smith made a\nnumbered time (Fixed) deposited for\ntwelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00\n(Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch. \n\nUpon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his\nforwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we\nsent a reminder and finally we discovered from his\ncontract employers, Randgold Exploration company Ltd\nthat Mr. Jim Smith died from an automobile accident.\nOn further investigation, I found\nout that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to\ntrace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made\nfurther investigation and discovered that Mr. Jim\nSmith did not declare any next of kin in all his\nofficial documents, including his Bank Deposit\npaperwork. \n\nThis sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the\nBank and the interest is being rolled over with the\nprincipal sum at the end of each year. No one will\ncome forward to claim it. According to the Nigerian\nLaw, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money\nwill revert to the ownership of the Nigerian\nGovernment if nobody applies to claim the funds.\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a\nforeigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Jim\nSmith so that the fruits of this old man's labour will\nnot get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This\nis simple, I will like you to provide me immediately\nwith your full names and address so that the attorney\nwill prepare the necessary documents and affidavits,\nwhich will put you in place as the next of kin. I\nwould also like you to scan you drivers license for\nme.\n\nWe shall employ the services of two attorneys for\n\ndrafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the\nnecessary documents and letter of\nprobate/administration in your favour for the\ntransfer. A\nbank account in any part of the world, which you\nprovide, will then facilitate the transfer of this\nmoney to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money\nwill be paid into your account for us to share in the\nratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. There is no risk\nat all as all the paperwork for this transaction will\nbe done by the attorney and my position as the Branch\nofficial guarantees the successful execution of this\ntransaction. \n\nIf you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon\nyour response, I shall then provide you with more\ndetails and relevant\ndocuments that will help you understand. Please\nobserve utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that\nthis transaction would be most profitable for both of\nus because I shall require your assistance to invest\nmy share in your country. \n\nAwaiting your urgent reply via my alternative  email address. \n\nThanks and regards, \n\nFadaka Randebe. \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n"

AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B)OUAGADOUGOU -BF REQUEST FOR THE URGENT TRANSFER OF THE SUM (US$10.5million) ONLY INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. You may be surprise to receive this message from me since you don't know me in person, but for the purpose of introduction., I got your impressive information through an international business equiry . But I respectfully insist you read crefully as I am optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial reward for both us. This business transaction might not fall within the wide spectrum of your business activities ,but I plead your assistance ,as your flair for profitable business is needed . Permit me to introduce myself. I am MR. YSOUF AROUNA. the Manager of auditing and accounting unit at the foreign remittance department of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK . In My department I discovered an abandoned sum of$ 10.5m US dollars . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in november 2002 in a plane crash. Since I got information about his death, I have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because wecannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased anindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately I learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the planecrash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don?t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned bythe fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, inrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 %will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me . There after I will visit your country with my family for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted . On your acceptance, I will send to the text of application by fax or by email which you are going to apply to the bank ; and provide materials confirmation references and inquiries regarding payment formalities from the payment Agency. I willbe handling official protocols here and expect you to undertake international responsibilities as I am assuring you of a risk free transaction provided you display maturity. Therefore, if you are willing and interested to render the needed assistance, endeavor to reply through my email address . Thanking you in anticipation of your kind considerations. Yours sincerely.

Your information was given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Government delegation on a trip to your country for a bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this business. Within the Department of Minerals & Energy where I work as a Director of Audit and Project Implementation and with the co-operation of two other t! ! op officials, we have in our possession an overdue payment in US funds. The said funds represent certain percentage of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$26.500,000.00 (TwentySix Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed. Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain good relationship with foreign governments and non-government agencies, we included our bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and the South Africa Reserve Bank (SARB). We are seeking your assistance to front as beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts. Details and change of beneficiary information upon application for claim to reflect payment and approvals will be secured on behalf of you/your Company. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be US$6.625m (25%), while my colleagues and I receive US$17.225m (65%) and the balance of US$2.650m (10%) for taxation and miscellaneous expenses incurred. The business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. It does not matter whether you/your Company does contract projects, as a transfer of powers will be secured in favour of you/your Company.

I sincerely ask for forgiveness for I know this may seem like a complete intrusion to your privacy but right about now this is my option of communication. This mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as unserious could come into your mind; but please consider it a divine wish and accept it with a deep sense of humility. I am aware that this is certainly an unconventional approach to starting a relationship. I am Mr. Dezaryi, the personal account officer to the great late diseased who has an account in one of the top banks here in South Africa. The account was opened in 2001 and he died in 2004 without a written or oral WILL and since 2004 nobody has operated on this account again hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing and Govt. of South Africa will confiscate the funds for their personal use which I personally don't want such incident to happen being that this is a great opportunity for me. My contact is for you to please assist me to transfer the fund ($172,654,000.00 USD) One Hundred & Seventy Two Million Six Hundred And Fifty Four Thousand United State Dollars from a Cooperate Bank here in South Africa to an oversea account. First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential. I am sure and have confidence of your ability and reliability to prosecute a transaction of this great magnitude. I solicit your assistance to enable us transfer the said amount into your safe account for onward investment. You can either provide us with an existing account or to set up a new Bank account immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business trusting in you and believing that you will never let me down either now or in future because this business is my life. The owner of this account is a foreigner and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of the company. My investigation through the National immigration department & Ministries here proved to me as well that he was single as at the time of his entry into the Republic of South Africa. The amount in this account is USD ($172,654,000.00 USD) Two Hundred & Twenty fifty million United States Dollars} only. As a matter of fact, I have decided to transfer this fund abroad for investment. Your assistance as a foreigner is necessary because the management of the bank will welcome any foreigner who has correct information to this account which I will give to you immediately, if you are interested to do this business with me. There is no risk in this business. With my position and my personal contact with the manager of the bank, the money can be transferred to any account you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing. We will start the first transfer with Fifty million [$50,000.000]. Upon successful transfer without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining balance of $122,654,000.00 Million to your account. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local person here, but can only be approved to any foreigner who has the correct information of the account, which I will provide for you. So you should provide me with your correct account details where you will like the fund to be transferred to, or you can set up a new account for the transfer even an empty account is ok. At the conclusion of the transfer you will take 45%, 6% will be for any expenses both parties incurred in the process of this business and the remaining 49% will be for me. As soon as I hear from you and upon your strong assurance that you will not let me down once the fund goes into your account I will then start the processing of the transfer of the fund to your account without further delay.

With Due Respect I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of african development bank (ADB). I crave your indulgence as i contact you in such a surprising manner. But I respectfully insist you read this letter carefully as I am optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial rewards for both of us. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Ten Million,Five Hundred Thousand US dollars (US$10.5m) only , in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2001 in a plan crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the plan crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you so that the money could be released to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and i dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as \"unclaimed fund\". The request for a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me. There after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name,your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.

I am married to Dr. Donald Adams A LIBERIAN but I\\ufffdm now in Nigerian General HOSPITAL taking treatment for my sickness, who worked with U.S embassy in LIBERIAN for nine years before he died in the year 2000. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$10.5 Million (Ten Million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with A Bank Presently, this money is still under the safe keeping of the Reserve FINANCE COMPANY Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next SEVEN months due to my cancer problems. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke.Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a Christian or muslim individual That will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church that will use this fund on, orphanages, deaf and domb and poor widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I forward your personal information, such as Your full name, Your full address, with Your telephone and fax number to my lawyer so that he will contact you as the legal owner of my fund before the bank will be transferring the fund into your nominated Bank Account in your country. I will also issue you a letter of a authority that will back you up as the real next of kin and the original- beneficiary of my fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd,you will also promise me that you will not seat on the fund when it gets into your bank account. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life, any delay in your reply will give me room in serching for a church or Christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible. Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.

I am Ali Raza Khan currently Head of Corporate Affairs Department with a reputable bank here in U. A. E. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 5th, 2000, a German business tycoon Mr. Andreas Schranner made a (Fixed deposit) for 60 calendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was moved to my present position recently. The maturity date for this deposit contract was last 3rd of April 2005. Before this date, I have tried my possible best to locate a Next of Kin to late Mr. Schranner, but all efforts prooved abortive, because all his family, including his Son In-Law and children died in the plane crash of Concorde Air France Flight AF4590 which took place on 25th July 2000, some months after he did the deposit in my bank. You can read more stories about the plane crash by visiting this website, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm With the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By end of October this year, the Government will pass a new Financial Control Law which will give the Government authority to interrogate account owners of above $5 million Dollars to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not for terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the country immediately, by October the Government will definitely confiscate the money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source of the money since he is late. I decided to utilize this life time opportunity, instead of Government confiscating the, but I cannot directly claim the money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance. As the Account Officer to late Mr. Schranner, coupled with my present position and status in the bank, I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the Next of Kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you. I am having the secret Code for the account, which only the account owner of his Next of Kin can know.

I shall explain to you in details how we shall handle the transaction once I receive your response. Thanking you in advance and May God blesses you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Mr. Schranner when the deposit was made for your perusal. I wait your urgent response. Regards, Ali Raza Khan.",

This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I will crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is MR WILLIAMS DANIEL of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace. Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary. WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a security company in the europe in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. Our inability to move this money out of Congo all This while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information We gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality. Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund out of Congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us. I must use this opportunity and medium to implore You to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this Matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your Decision, while I await your prompt response.

ANDREAS, a foreigner, and a miner at Kruger gold co, a geologist by profession and he died since 1990. No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and the amount involve! d is (US$26M) TWENTY SIX MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS.

THIS IS MY PRIVATE E-MAIL BOX:james221_2006@yahoo.com My name is Mr.JAMES BROWN. I am the credit AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT,BANK OF AFRICA,COTONOU-BENIN REPBLIC. I am contacting you of a business transfer, of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that everything has been taken care off, and all will be well at the end of the day. I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction. PROPOSITION; I am the account officer of a foreigner named Gerald Welsh who died in an air crash along with his wife on the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below which was published by BBC WORLD NEWS. WEBSITE. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm Since his death, none of his next-of-kin are alive to make claims for this money as his heir, because they all died in the same accident himself and his wife(May their soul rest in peace). We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked out by me for the funds (USD 10,700,000.00) to be released in your favor as the beneficiary's next of kin. Because after four years the money will be called back to the bank treasury as unclaimed bills and the money shared amongst the directors of the bank. so it is on this note i decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to share this money amongst themselves at the end of the year. It may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries. Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information if you are interested. 1.A Beneficiary name. In order for me to prepare the document for transfer of the funds in your name. 2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers. For our personal contact and mutual trust in each other. I shall be compensating you with [3million Million Dollars) on final conclusion of this project for your assistance, while the balance of 5 Million Dollars shall be for me for investment purposes. Because I intend to retire after the conclusion of this transaction. If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endeavor to contact me immediately.

The message could be strange but real, if you pay some attention to it. I could have notified you about it at least for the sake of your integrity. I am Mrs. Nazek Hariri, wife of the late Prime Minister of Lebanon, Mr Rafiq Hariri, who was assassinated on 14 February 2005, along with 20 others,near the St. George Hotel in Beirut.In the wake of his assassination on 14 February 2005, the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan dispatched a fact-finding mission to investigate the killing. Arriving in Beirut on 25 February, the mission interviewed Lebanese officials and politicians, from both the government and opposition, studied the Lebanese investigation and legal proceedings, examined the crime scene and collected evidence. It also interviewed some Witnesses.The report emphasizes that it is impossible to identify the culprits until the perpetrators have been brought to justice, but blames the Syrian government, which it charges with exerting influence that goes beyond the reasonable exercise of cooperative or neighbourly relations, with primary responsibility for the political tension that preceded the assassination, by its (interference) with the details of governance in Lebanon in a heavy-handed and inflexible manner.Since the perpetrators of these evil act has not been brought to justice, l have the feelings that l am not also save here in Beirut. I intend leaving Lebanon for greener pasture.During my husband's regime as the Prime Minister of Lebanon, He realized some reasonable amount of money from various deals that I successfully executed. The money was deposited by my husband in my name, Mrs. Nazek Hariri, in a Finance Firm in Europe. I have plans to invest this money outside Lebanon.I am contacting you because am looking for a trusted and reliable person that will represent me in Europe to claim the money on my behalf. I have sent a notification letter to the financier institution, that the consignment will be collected by the family foreign business partner.Why l need a foreign partner is that, as an Arab woman, the tradition forbids me to run any business with my son (Saadeddine).

(Assalam! ) Email Addres:bukidogo116@yahoo.co.uk Tel: +27762901347 ATTN: MANAGING DIRECTOR / CEO I know you will be surprised to read a letter from me but please Consider this as a request from a family in dare need of assistance. I am the wife of late Brigadier AL-Jubril Dogo from Dafur Region, Sudan. my name is Mrs Buki Dogo, Writing to you from Sudan. My son got your contact information from a business directory in Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry. And I on behalf of my late husband and my only son, decided to solicit for your assistance to transfer the sum of US$17 million dollars, from my late husband's trust account with a bank in South Africa, into your company or Private bank account. Before the death of my husband, he was a Brigadier in-charge of Arms and ammunition procurement for the Darfur Liberation Front (D. L. F.). In his will, he specifically drew my son's attention to the sum of US$17 million, which he had deposited, in the vault of a Bank in Johannesburg, South Africa as a family treasure, but it is truly cash while he boxed it in the bank as a family treasure due to security reasons. In fact, he said and I quote ?\\ufffdmy beloved son, I wish to draw your attention to the sum of US$17 million. I deposited the said fund in a private account of a Bank in Johannesburg, South Africa; all the documents regarding the fund are with your mother. I was very dedicated and committed to wining the ongoing war against the rebels until when I found out that some senior army officers and government functionaries were busy helping themselves with government funds and properties, sending them to foreign countries. Due to this, when I and former special adviser to the President were assigned by the President (Hassan al-Bashir) to purchase arms in South Africa, we saw this as an opportunity to divert the money for our personal use. When we divided the money, my share was US$17 million. I did this in case of my absence due to death so that you, Abubaka your two sisters and your mother wouldn't suffer. Take my advice my son; and please be serious with your Studies, I will like you to please take care of this money properly for your future and of your mother's and sisters You should solicit for assistance of a reliable and sincere foreign partner to assist you to transfer this money out of South Africa for investment. I deposited the money in your name and you alone with the deposit code, for you to can claim it. Your mother is with all the documents; take good care of your mother and your two sisters. Do not disappoint me! Good-bye. From this word of my late husband, you will understand that the lives and future of my family depend on this fund as such I will be grateful if you can assist us. Now what I want you to do for us is to help us clear this sum from the bank using your name which should be as the foreign partner of my late husband. You can contact my son (Abubaka Dogo) who is now in South Africa on his telephone number 27-762901347,or email: abudogo@hotmail.com+ , for more details. I am preparing to travel to South Africa before the transaction continues, as the war is worsening more and more. We have agreed to give you 20% of the total sum for your assistance and 5% for the expenses that might be incurred in the course of the Transfer and the remaining 75% for the family investment abroad, which you will also assist us to materialize. Further information and Discussion about this transaction will commence as soon as you give us the assurance and confidence that this money will be safe when transferred to your account and, please treat this matter with urgency. Note that this transaction is 100% free from risk as our banker and lawyer have taking care of all the arrangement. Thanks and May Allah Bless us. Best Regards, MRS BUKI DOGO.",

I am the wife of late Brigadier AL-Jubril Dogo from Dafur Region, Sudan. my name is Mrs Buki Dogo, Writing to you from Sudan.\n\nMy son got your contact information from a business directory in Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry. And I on behalf of my late husband and my only son, decided to solicit for your assistance to transfer the sum of US$17 million dollars, from my late husband's trust account  with a bank in South Africa, into your company or Private bank account.\n\nBefore the death of my husband, he was a Brigadier in-charge of Arms and ammunition procurement for the Darfur Liberation Front (D. L. F.). In his will, he specifically drew my son's attention to the sum of US$17 million, which he had deposited, in the vault of a Bank in Johannesburg, South Africa as a family treasure, but it is truly cash while he boxed it in\nthe bank as a family treasure due to security reasons.\nIn fact, he said and I quote ?\ufffdmy beloved son, I wish to draw your attention to the sum of US$17 million. I deposited the said fund in a private account of a Bank in Johannesburg, South Africa; all the documents regarding the fund are with your mother.\n\nI was very dedicated and committed to wining the ongoing war against the rebels until when I found out that some senior army officers and government functionaries were busy helping themselves with government funds and properties, sending them to foreign countries. Due to this, when I and former special adviser to the President were assigned by the President (Hassan al-Bashir) to purchase arms in South Africa, we saw this as an opportunity to divert the money for our personal use.\n\nWhen we divided the money, my share was US$17 million. I did this in case of my absence due to death so that you, Abubaka your two sisters and your mother wouldn't suffer. Take my advice my son; and please be serious with your Studies, I will like you to please take care\nof this money properly for your future and of your mother's and sisters\nYou should solicit for assistance of a reliable and sincere foreign partner to assist you to transfer this money out of South Africa for investment. I deposited the money in your name and you alone with the deposit code, for you to can claim it. Your mother is with all the documents; take good care of your mother and your two sisters. Do not disappoint me! Good-bye.\nFrom this word of my late husband, you will understand that the lives and future of my family depend on this fund as such I will be grateful if you can assist us. Now what I want you to do for us is to help us clear this sum from the bank using your name which should be as the foreign partner of my late husband. You can contact my son (Abubaka Dogo) who is now in South Africa on his telephone number  27-762901347,or email: abudogo@hotmail.com+ , for more details. I am preparing to\ntravel to South Africa before the transaction continues, as the war is worsening more and more.\n\nWe have agreed to give you 20% of the total sum for your assistance and 5% for the expenses that might be incurred in the course of the Transfer and the remaining 75% for the family investment abroad, which you will also assist us to materialize. Further information and Discussion about this transaction will commence as soon as you give us the assurance and\nconfidence that this money will be safe when transferred to your account and, please treat this\nmatter with urgency. Note that this transaction is 100% free from risk as our banker and lawyer have taking care of all the arrangement.\n\nThanks and May Allah Bless us.\nBest Regards, \nMRS BUKI DOGO."

I am contacting you in view of the fact we will be of great assistance to each other, likewise developing a cordial business relationship. I currently have within my reach the sum of Fifty-five Million United States Dollars ($55,000,000,00) cash, which I intend to use for investment purposes specifically in your country. This money came as a result of a pay-back contract deal between my late husband and a Russian firm in our country's Multi-billion dollar Ajaokuta Steel plant. The Russian partners returned my Husband's share of US$55,000,000.00 U.S.D after his death, and lodged it in my late husband's Security company of which I am a Director Right now, the new Civilian Government has intensified their probe on my late Husband's Financial resources and have frozen our accounts. In view of these facts, I acted fast to withdraw the US$55,000,000.00 U.S.D from the company's vault and deposited it in a privately owned security safe in my village. I have since declared the security company bankrupt. No record whatsoever exists concerning the money traceable by the Government because, there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the Russians. Due to the current situation in the country concerning the Government's attitude towards my husband, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within; thus upon consent, I shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction. Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, I propose a commission of 10% (ten percent) of the total sum to you for the expected services and assistance.

Dear , Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that everything will be well at the end of the day. We have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.I got your email address while searching for a trustworthy individual. Let me start by introducing myself properly to you.I am Mr. malcom tutu , an auditor with Ned Credict Bank, Johannesburg, South Africa . MY PROPOSITION: A Foreigner a french, Late Engr.Peter Claude (Snr) a merchant in The Republic of South Africa, Formerly working in Witwatersrand Johannesburg Gold Mine, Johannesburg South Africa until his death few year ago in Kenya Air Bus (A310 - 304)Flight KQ431, He banked with us at Ned Credict Bank Johannesburg and had a closing balance as at the end of September, 2000 worth $30,800.000.00 (Thirty Million eight hundred United State Dollars), (this is aside the accrued interest so far from that date) the bank now expects his next of kin as beneficiary. Valuable efforts are being made by the Bank to get in touch with any of the Claude's Family or Relatives but to no success. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any of Late Engr. Peter Claude (Snr.)'s next of kin . The Management under the influence of our Chairman and Members of the Board of Directors, Thus that arrangement will be made for the fund to be decleared \"Unclaimed\" and subsequentlly be donated to the trust fund for arms and ammunition to further enhance the course of War in Africa and the World in General. In order to avert this negative development, some of my trusted colleagues and I, now seek your permission to have you stand as next of kin to the late Engr.peter Claude (Snr.) so that the fund will be released and paid into your Account as the beneficiary/next of kin. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer(Claude) was a foreigner and a Local person here in the country cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. All documents and proves to enable you get this fund will be carefully worked out. We have secured from the probate registry, an order of Mandamus to locate any of the deceased's beneficiary(ies), and more so we are assuring you that this business is 100% Risk Free. Your share will be 30% of the total sum while 10% will be set aside for any expences incured during the course of transaction, The rest of 60% will be for myself and my colleagues for investment purposes, According to agreement between both parties. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where-in the money will be remitted .

To provide either an existing bank account or set up a new Bank account immediately to receive this fund, even an empty account can serve this purpose, or you help to seek an honest and. reliable businessman who can assist us. I am HON.EDWARD TAYLOR an accountant and bank manager, during the course of our auditing I discovered a floating fund.in.a domiciliary account opened in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this account,after going through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of the account who is a foreigner died without any traceable next of Kin hence the dormant nature of the account and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be re-channeled into the bank\ufffd reserve. I suggest we start the first transfer with five million Dollars [$5,000.000] and upon the successful transfer of the first $5 million without hitches or disappointment from you, I shall re-apply for the remittance of the balance of the fund to your nominated account.

During the reign of my cousin, Charles Taylor, I was in-charge of all Diamond operations coming from Angola, Sierra Leone, etc. Then Charles Taylor enjoyed the patronage of the rebels controlling parts of these countries, as tonnes of uncut diamond were shipped to him, and he inturn through me sold these diamonds to foreigners, and used the proceeds to buy arms for the rebels in these countries, and a large chunk of this money was for the enrichment of the rebel leaders. Literally speaking he gave cover to the rebel Leaders. This operation was code named: Conflict Diamond. I cordinated the entire Diamond trade in the sub-region and this ran into hundreds of Million of Dollar. While carrying out this operation, I was able to divert the sum of US$45,000,000.00 (Forty-Five Million United States Dollars) for my personal benefit, and it is concelled into 4 Trunk Boxes and deposited as artifacts materials with ecowas diplomatic Security and cargo unit in Accra-Ghana. The Security Company does not know the true contents of the consignments. This is only known to you and me, and I hope you will keep this confidential. Now that Charles Taylor is no more in Power, I thought it wise to move the money out to any country of the world for investment purposes. Now I am contacting you seeking your assistance to help me in transfering this money to your country. All you need do is to make necesary arrangement and fly down to Accra-Ghana, see the money and talk about it. Already, I have the consent of the Security Company Director in Accra-Ghana who has agreed to help us move the consignments out through Diplomatic means to their affilliate office in Europe. I am offering you 25% of the total amount involved for assisting me while 5% is set aside for any expenses that might be incurred during the completion of this project, and the remaining 70% will be used for any lucrative investment you will introduce me into.

Some years ago, an American Mining consultant/ contractor with the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation,made a numbered time (fixed)deposit for twelve calendar months, valued $42M.USD (FORTY TWO MILLION US DOLLARS) in an account. On maturity, The bank sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, The bank sent another reminder and finally his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation wrote to inform the bank that he died without MAKING A WILL, and all attempts by the American Embassy to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore, made further investigation and discovered that the beneficiary was an immigrant from Jamaica and only recently obtained American citizenship. He did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank deposit paper work. This money total amount$42M.USD ( FORTY TWO MILLION US DOLLARS)is still sitting in my bank as dormant Account. No one will ever come forward to claim it, and according to Nigerian Banking policy, after some years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if the account owner is certified dead. This is the situation, and my proposal is that I am looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to beneficiary, and OPEN a Bank Account abroad to facilitate the transfer of this money. This is simple, all you have to do is to OPEN an account anywhere in the world and send me its detail for me to arrange the proper money transfer paperwork, and facilitate the transfer.The money will then be paid into this Account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me, 35 % for you and 5% for expenses that might come up during transfer process. There is no risk at all, and all the paper work for this transaction will be done by me using my position and connections in the banks in Nigeria. This business transaction is guaranteed.And the first phase of the transfer will be ($4M.USD) FOUR MILLION DOLLARS as advised by our insider in the bank.If you are interested, please reply immediately through my personal email sending the following details: (1) Your Full Name/Address (2) Your Private Telephone/fax Number. Please observe the utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest some of my share in your country. I look forward to your earliest reply. Yours, Mr.Daniez Philip",

After all, most chroniclers of Russian life base their tales in Moscow or, alternately, St. Petersburg, the most livable of Russia's not-very-livable cities. Deciding instead to settle in a former academic community outside of Novosibirsk, one of Siberia's major cities, Blakely set out to pursue, as his book's subtitle declares, \"the American dream on Russia's wild frontier.\" Blakely, who moved to Siberia after finishing college with an economics degree, has a breezy writing style. And although his book is flawed in many respects, it does include some sharp observations of life in Russia. \"Usually with construction,\" he tells us, for instance, \"you have two choices: 1) you can do it quickly, or 2) you can do it right. The Soviet construction worker . . . takes his time doing things wrong.\" Anyone who has spent time in Siberia knows that its inhabitants are a breed apart. They disdain their compatriots in the country's Western regions and pride themselves -- perhaps excessively -- on their courage, strength and inner fortitude. Siberia, in fact, occupies a space in the Russian national psyche similar to that of the Wild West in American mythology. The efforts throughout the 16th and 17th centuries to settle Siberia's vast expanse and exploit its natural resources still resonate with Russians. So does the region's role as a convenient dumping ground for criminals and political dissidents during the czarist centuries and as home to the cruel network of gulags in Soviet times. Unfortunately, little of this rich brew of history and myth makes an appearance in Siberia Bound. Neither do lots of other pertinent facts. Russians often say that, in Russia, anything can happen -- and usually does. So it's easy to believe that two young men could establish a chocolate business on little more than hope, smarts and chutzpah. But while Blakely describes establishing a cocoa-bean importing business with his friend Sasha, we never learn how they met in the first place or why he believes Sasha to be a trustworthy associate. The two of them strike a deal to sell their beans to a local chocolate factory, yet we find out virtually nothing about the chocolate the factory produces. Is it tasty? Disgusting? Are we talking chocolate bars, chocolate truffles or chocolate syrup? A few details would go a long way here. The author has the makings of a terrific story. But even though Siberia Bound includes frequent humorous episodes, Blakely generally fails to transform the pungent ingredients into a satisfying meal. The constant descriptions of encounters and conversations ultimately differ little from one another. People are forever winking, smirking and slapping one another on the back. Slamming down shots of vodka and making sentimental toasts to women and friendship play an inevitable role in any account of Russian life, but reading about such occasions becomes tiresome after the 20th or 30th repetition. Blakely is also given to facile comments that are meant to sound smart but often fall flat. \"Democracy and the free market, the best institutions the West had to offer, stormed over the borders and ran deep into Russia,\" he tells us. \"But like all foreign armies throughout history, they quickly were spread too thin and became diluted.\" And then there's this summation of his time in Russia: \"Those four years have left me with a lifetime of rabid ambivalence to chew on until I've got no teeth left.\" Blakely manages to include a few unpleasant -- and wholly unnecessary -- laughs at the expense of Chinese workers and gays. And although I like wordplay as much as the next guy, it's jarring when non-English-speaking characters make puns in English. \"In a pinch,\" says one character, a chocolate factory director who warns Blakely not to store extra cocoa beans on site, \"I'm afraid we would probably take a pinch.\" Some of these faults wouldn't matter if Siberia Bound were a picaresque novel or an account that didn't aspire to authenticity. But the effect here is to undermine a reader's faith in the narrator's reliability and to reduce most of the characters to the stock figures encountered in dozens of other accounts of Russian life. So in the end, I believed the broad contours of Blakely's story but found it hard to take seriously many of the particulars. And his ultimate conclusion -- that capitalism, material comfort and wealth do not bring happiness -- hardly qualifies as a revelation.

In this case, I had two issues. 1. I mirrored the disk to give to someone else to work on but the box he has available has only a P1 or P2 processor. 2. My celeron box has been crashing the backup software so I wanted to try out the backup in a different box to make sure it's hardware related. Again, it's also an interesting exercise... > Have you thought about mirroring the system drives? Might save you serious > hassle down the line. Oh, I'm doing that too. This is going to Africa so I'm aiming for as robust as possible with belt, braces and probably an all-in-one jumpsuit! I'll be mirroring the disk but that is worth only so much (eg. lightning strike taking out the disk(s) or system compromise) I'm also going for a backup to CDR with an automated restore http://www.mondorescue.org . The admin out there wouldn't be able to build the system again if the mobo got fried and the replacement was the wrong arch but an i386 compatible install will mean just dropping in the HD and booting (ish)...

In this case, I had two issues.  1. I mirrored the disk to give to\nsomeone else to work on but the box he has available has only a P1 or P2\nprocessor.  2. My celeron box has been crashing the backup software so I\nwanted to try out the backup in a different box to make sure it's hardware\nrelated.  Again, it's also an interesting exercise...\n \n> Have you thought about mirroring the system drives? Might save you serious\n> hassle down the line. \n\nOh, I'm doing that too.  This is going to Africa so I'm aiming for as\nrobust as possible with belt, braces and probably an all-in-one jumpsuit!\nI'll be mirroring the disk but that is worth only so much (eg. lightning\nstrike taking out the disk(s) or system compromise)  I'm also going for a\nbackup to CDR with an automated restore http://www.mondorescue.org .  The\nadmin out there wouldn't be able to build the system again if the mobo got\nfried and the replacement was the wrong arch but an i386 compatible\ninstall will mean just dropping in the HD and booting (ish)...\n\nConor\n-- \nConor Daly <conor.daly@oceanfree.net>\n\nDomestic Sysadmin :-)\n---------------------\nFaenor.cod.ie\n  2:32pm  up 64 days, 23:49,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00\nHobbiton.cod.ie\n  2:19pm  up 7 days, 20:56,  1 user,  load average: 0.05, 0.02, 0.00\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"

This is true, statistically, because most > people are poor and most people are also stupid. I never said that rich people are smart, just less stupid than most other people. And most people who are poor do engage in more reckless and stupid behavior in my experience; the people that are a bit smarter don't stay poor for long, so it is a self-selecting population. Hell, I grew up in as abject a poverty as you can find in the US and I remember quite well why the people that stayed poor were poor -- it certainly wasn't because of The Man. And my parents were poor because they made lots of stupid choices -- I had front row seats to the whole process. Unlike many others, I actually learned from the experience. And I've known a lot of wealthy people (both in a strict monetary sense and general sense), and I can't think of a one that was a fool. People who earned their wealth (i.e. 95+% of the wealthy in the US) didn't manage to do so, and maintain their wealth, because they were fools. It isn't that these people are that much smarter, they just don't make lots of bad decisions and stupid mistakes. Being very smart AND not making lots of stupid mistakes is pretty much a surefire recipe for being wealthy. > Being smart, for example, has made Stephen Hawking famous and > respected, but he's not particularly rich. Jennifer Lopez is by > all accounts a complete moron.

You are using a very narrow definition of \"smart\". Smart doesn't make you rich, it gives you the *choice* to be rich. Many people (e.g. Stephen Hawking) are quite happy merely being comfortable and devote their energy elsewhere than being \"rich\". But I don't know too many really smart people that actually choose to live in poverty. > [...ridiculous caricature of wealthy people elided...] > At the granular level, the notion that \"most rich people are rich > because they're smart\" is so anecdotal and naive that it's not > worth arguing about, so I won't. Still, a compelling point worth > some clarification. It sounds like you've bought into the absurd Hollywood depictions of what wealthy people are like. Hint: they are exactly like you and me, but with a higher net worth. In the U.S., the fact is that two-thirds of the millionaires are blue collar folks who worked very smart and very hard, and the vast majority of all the wealthy in the U.S. are completely self-made (i.e. first-generation wealthy). \"Old wealth\" is incredibly rare in the U.S., as it typically comes and goes within three generations, and the handful that you do hear about are the unusually long-lived exceptions. It's quite simple to become wealthy in the U.S. if you put some effort into it. However, most people prefer to merely be comfortable and expend a lot less energy. Virtually all the people I know who are wealthy are chronic workaholics with above average intelligence and exaggerated amounts of drive. Most people would not consider those people's lives \"fun\", though those people tend to enjoy what they do. -James Rogers jamesr@best.com http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",

People\nwho earned their wealth (i.e. 95+% of the wealthy in the US) didn't\nmanage to do so, and maintain their wealth, because they were fools.  It\nisn't that these people are that much smarter, they just don't make lots\nof bad decisions and stupid mistakes.

Smart doesn't make\nyou rich, it gives you the *choice* to be rich. Many people (e.g.\nStephen Hawking) are quite happy merely being comfortable and devote\ntheir energy elsewhere than being \"rich\".  But I don't know too many\nreally smart people that actually choose to live in poverty.\n\n\n> [...ridiculous caricature of wealthy people elided...]\n> At the granular level, the notion that \"most rich people are rich \n> because they're smart\" is so anecdotal and naive that it's not \n> worth arguing about, so I won't.

Hint: they are exactly like you and me,\nbut with a higher net worth.  In the U.S., the fact is that two-thirds\nof the millionaires are blue collar folks who worked very smart and very\nhard, and the vast majority of all the wealthy in the U.S. are\ncompletely self-made (i.e. first-generation wealthy).  \"Old wealth\" is\nincredibly rare in the U.S., as it typically comes and goes within three\ngenerations, and the handful that you do hear about are the unusually\nlong-lived exceptions.\n\nIt's quite simple to become wealthy in the U.S. if you put some effort\ninto it.  However, most people prefer to merely be comfortable and\nexpend a lot less energy.  Virtually all the people I know who are\nwealthy are chronic workaholics with above average intelligence and\nexaggerated amounts of drive.  Most people would not consider those\npeople's lives \"fun\", though those people tend to enjoy what they do.\n\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"

I still disagree with the reasoning, but it seems this is one of those philosophical questions that I'm on the losing end of :) The checkinstall utility that someone mentioned seems useful, but I don't really have the time to figure it out right now. After searching the web some more, I found out that Mandrake's version of rpm is patched to support what I wanted. So I guess I'll look into that when I get a chance.

As far as I can tell, this could be useful for my situation too. It's not a complete solution since I can't really distribute the SRPMS with full certainty that they work, but at least I can make RPMS for local use by tarring up the buildroot directory and then using the above technique. All I really want is to get dependency tracking for everything installed on my system (including software from cvs).

I still disagree with the \nreasoning, but it seems this is one of those philosophical questions \nthat I'm on the losing end of :)\n\nThe checkinstall utility that someone mentioned seems useful, but I \ndon't really have the time to figure it out right now. After searching \nthe web some more, I found out that Mandrake's version of rpm is \npatched to support what I wanted. So I guess I'll look into that when \nI get a chance.\n\nOn Thu, Aug 15, 2002 at 05:14:47PM +0200, Ralf Ertzinger wrote:\n> Do nothing in the %build section, and copy the existing binaries\n> in %install.\n\nAs far as I can tell, this could be useful for my situation too. It's \nnot a complete solution since I can't really distribute the SRPMS with \nfull certainty that they work, but at least I can make RPMS for local \nuse by tarring up the buildroot directory and then using the above \ntechnique. All I really want is to get dependency tracking for \neverything installed on my system (including software from cvs). This \njust makes it a little bit faster.\n\ngary\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n"

But also on my ftp://people.redhat.com/ckloiber page is rpms for the rar-3.00 file archiving/unarchiving program. This is distributed as a binary tarball only, and I repackaged it based originally on an earlier version of rar I found on the net, just for practice. It also makes use of subpackages, and I was both proud of myself for getting it to work, and sickened that I repackaged binary-only crap.

But also on my ftp://people.redhat.com/ckloiber page is\nrpms for the rar-3.00 file archiving/unarchiving program. This is\ndistributed as a binary tarball only, and I repackaged it based\noriginally on an earlier version of rar I found on the net, just for\npractice. It also makes use of subpackages, and I was both proud of\nmyself for getting it to work, and sickened that I repackaged\nbinary-only crap. Enjoy.\n\n-- \nChris Kloiber\n\n_______________________________________________\nRPM-List mailing list <RPM-List@freshrpms.net>\nhttp://lists.freshrpms.net/mailman/listinfo/rpm-list\n\n"

Of course, that attitude is why > I've been fixing exmh bugs for 3 weeks. I just checked in a code cleanup which doesn't address this issue, but does take a machete to code right around it. You ought to 'cvs update' and see if your issue becomes any clearer with all the brush removed. My patch notes that 'msgid' and 'line' are redundant with one another and removes one or the other from functions which takes both. The callers are then changed to pass what the function expects. In the case of Msg_Change, the 'line' argument is removed and we only have the msgid argument. Ftoc_ClearCurrent is now the first line of MsgChange.

We have found biomass (large cluster of organisms) using methane that geologists show could have existed around four billion years ago,' Professor Antje Boetius, joint author of the study, told Reuters. Link: Yes, she exists. Dr. Antje does more than exist. She gives some kinda publicity shot. Dang! http://www.mpi-bremen.de/deutsch/biogeo/aboetius/aboetius.html http://www.iu-bremen.de/directory/faculty/01063/ \"The two-year research by the scientists from Hamburg University, the Alfred Wegener Institute in northern Bremerhaven and the Max Planck Society centred on coral-forming micro-organisms in the Black Sea at depths where no oxygen and no light is present. \"The Black Sea contains the largest oxygen-free basin in the world. \"The lifeforms were able to process methane together with sulphates within the water, producing carbonates, in the form of coral, as waste. (((Black, oxygen-free \"coral\". I wonder what that stuff looks like. Maybe you could make jewelry out of it.))) \"That they were able to do so without oxygen suggests they may have been around before plant life. \"'Perhaps micro-organisms like those found in the Black Sea were the original inhabitants of the earth during a long period of the earth's history,' said Boetius. (((Yeah, they've just been sitting down there, waiting to save our bacon.))) \"She believes the findings could prove useful for climate control. \"Previously, scientists had thought that methane, found in abundance in the sea and produced through agriculture, could only be broken down with oxygen. \"The German researchers believe the discovery of a pool of organisms that process methane without oxygen could lead to a way of cutting down potentially harmful greenhouse gases without burning oxygen and producing similarly damaging carbon dioxide. (((What do they *smell* like?))) \"'It could be a way of hindering climate catastrophe,'\" Boetius said. O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O BY ALL MEANS LET'S HINDER SOME CATASTROPHE O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O",

There are other brands and various other tape formats to choose from, but just to give you a rough benchmark of pricing for that sorta capacity. Ther are options that will go up to crazy capacities by using using multiple tapes in a caddy... of course its gonna cost a lot more. I'd also be ensuring I had some sort of disk mirroring set up also... the more redundancy the better (within reason).

Is it possible to get some sort of low- end internal tape / other solution that could be used to back up approx. 40 Gigs of data or am I just dreaming? My ISP does offer backups at extra cost but the only problem with that is, well, the extra cost. What I was hoping to do was to install some kind of internal tape device, then swap tapes round every month, so I had an onsite backup of say the last 24 hours and an offsite backup of the last month. Is this feasible? I'm beginning to think it isn't. External devices are not an option as part of the charge for colocation is rackspace.

Maybe I'm the only one confused but what you are saying is that you have a spamtrap that receives Bugtraq messages and you are auto- matically reporting them as SPAM only to revoke them shortly there- after??? Either way automatic reporting is a Bad Thing (tm) IMHO. You should review and then report spamtrap or otherwise. I'm not sure how this would affect your rating because I don't have any docs nor code to look at but I sincerely hope that if that's what you are doing that it negatively impacts your rating at a near exponential rate with every report/revoke cycle. > Btw, what does \"TeS\" stand for?

Either way automatic reporting is a Bad Thing (tm) IMHO.\nYou should review and then report spamtrap or otherwise.

A Linux distribution (_any_ Linux distribution) contains lots and lots of separate codebases. Some are under the GNU GPL. Many are not. Are you clear on this point, now? This is my second try. One suspects that you actually understand perfectly, but just don't like it. You're further confused if you think the GNU GPL gives you the right to get covered software for free. It does not. It provides that _if_ you've lawfully received a copy of the covered binary version, you have rights to also receive the matching source code. > I don't particularly need support, so I'm not really interested in > purchasing a set of disks with 4 billion apps which I'll never use. Then, if you nonetheless want a SuSE boxed set's contents, the only way you can do that without copyright violation _and_ without having to pay the purchase price is to get someone to _give_ (not \"lend\" or duplicate) you his copy. > Yes, thanks for your input. Anyway, I've a friend with 7.3 pro, so > I'll just ask him. Ask him _what_? If you're asking him to \"lend\" or duplicate his CDs, then you'll be ripping off SuSE Linux AG illegally. Don't like SuSE's product licensing? Write your own distribution. You can even grab most of what you need _from SuSE_. All you have to do is heed the licensing terms on the individual pieces. What, you think that's too much work? Then, try a different distribution. Clue: _Not_ one packaged in a retail boxed set. Even RH 7.3 retail boxed sets include non-freely redistributable applications on the Star office 5.2 CD and the Productivity Applications CD, among others. (The core 3-CD set of the basic RH distribution, on the other hand, contains only software that may be freely redistributed, whether open source or not.) -- Hi! I'm a .signature virus!

I thought it was GPL'ed and that the money you paid SuSE\n> was for your 60 day support or whatever? \n\nYes, you're confused.\n\nA Linux distribution (_any_ Linux distribution) contains lots and lots\nof separate codebases.  Some are under the GNU GPL.  Many are not.  Are\nyou clear on this point, now?  This is my second try.  One suspects that\nyou actually understand perfectly, but just don't like it.\n\nYou're further confused if you think the GNU GPL gives you the right to\nget covered software for free.  It does not.  It provides that _if_\nyou've lawfully received a copy of the covered binary version, you have\nrights to also receive the matching source code.\n\n> I don't particularly need support, so I'm not really interested in\n> purchasing a set of disks with 4 billion apps which I'll never use.\n\nThen, if you nonetheless want a SuSE boxed set's contents, the only way\nyou can do that without copyright violation _and_ without having to pay\nthe purchase price is to get someone to _give_ (not \"lend\" or duplicate) \nyou his copy.\n\n> Yes, thanks for your input. Anyway, I've a friend with 7.3 pro, so\n> I'll just ask him.\n\nAsk him _what_?  If you're asking him to \"lend\" or duplicate his CDs,\nthen you'll be ripping off SuSE Linux AG illegally.\n\nDon't like SuSE's product licensing?  Write your own distribution.  You\ncan even grab most of what you need _from SuSE_.  All you have to do is \nheed the licensing terms on the individual pieces.\n\nWhat, you think that's too much work?  Then, try a different\ndistribution.  Clue:  _Not_ one packaged in a retail boxed set.  Even RH\n7.3 retail boxed sets include non-freely redistributable applications on\nthe Star office 5.2 CD and the Productivity Applications CD, among\nothers.  (The core 3-CD set of the basic RH distribution, on the other\nhand, contains only software that may be freely redistributed, whether \nopen source or not.)\n\n-- \nHi! I'm a .signature virus!

Exactly what rights you would have to the code depends on the contractual arrangement you have with your client, and I'm betting that that's not at all cut and dried. However, I have been in this situation where a client was using code I developed and then decided that he should own the code. Push never came to shove (at least, not yet :-) ) but my understanding of the situation vis a vis software is that in the absence of any contract granting ownership of the code to another party, it remains with the person who wrote it. I didn't take legal advice on this but my customer did :-) and his lawyer told him that I was right and would most likely win in court. So much for the ownership of the code vis a vis you and your client - now for the GPL issues. Code compiled by a compiler which is GPL software (e.g. gcc) is not itself covered by the GPL unless its author chooses to make it so. This is perhaps not made clear enough in the GPL text and is a particular piece of FUD which Microsoft loves to toss about. Similarly, the copy of PHP which is part of your customer's system is covered by the GPL. You can charge him whatever you like for it but you must provide him with acces to the source code, and you cannot restrict what he can do with it (in this case, move it to another service provider). However, you have not (I take it) chosen to license YOUR code under the GPL so the conditions of the GPL do NOT apply to it. If OTOH you had written some code which modified PHP as such, and then distributed (whether for a fee or not) that modified PHP, then the modified code must be licensed under the GPL. But this applies to a modification to PHP itself and NOT to your scripts which run under PHP. The relevant clause is 2(b) which says (though Lord knows why I'm quoting when locate COPYING will turn up a shedload of copies of the GPL on just about any Linux box - 540 on this box) b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. Your PHP scripts do not contain, nor are they derived from, PHP, in whole or in part. > I know this is not strictly a 'Linux' issue but any help would be appreciated Microsoft has very much made this a Linux issue - it has attempted to imply that any company using GPL software must make everything it owns public and it must be true - that nice man from Microsoft wouldn't lie, would he ?

Push never came to\nshove (at least, not yet :-) ) but my understanding of the situation vis a\nvis software is that in the absence of any contract granting ownership of\nthe code to another party, it remains with the person who wrote it. I didn't\ntake legal advice on this but my customer did :-) and his lawyer told him\nthat I was right and would most likely win in court.\n\nSo much for the ownership of the code vis a vis you and your client - now for\nthe GPL issues. \n\nCode compiled by a compiler which is GPL software (e.g. gcc) is not itself\ncovered by the GPL unless its author chooses to make it so. This is perhaps\nnot made clear enough in the GPL text and is a particular piece of FUD which\nMicrosoft loves to toss about. Similarly, the copy of PHP which is part of\nyour customer's system is covered by the GPL. You can charge him whatever\nyou like for it but you must provide him with acces to the source code, and\nyou cannot restrict what he can do with it (in this case, move it to another\nservice provider). However, you have not (I take it) chosen to license YOUR\ncode under the GPL so the conditions of the GPL do NOT apply to it.\n\nIf OTOH you had written some code which modified PHP as such, and then\ndistributed (whether for a fee or not) that modified PHP, then the modified\ncode must be licensed under the GPL. But this applies to a modification to\nPHP itself and NOT to your scripts which run under PHP.\n\nThe relevant clause is 2(b) which says (though Lord knows why I'm quoting when\nlocate COPYING will turn up a shedload of copies of the GPL on just about\nany Linux box - 540 on this box)\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\nin part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\nlicensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of\nthis License.\n\n\nYour PHP scripts do not contain, nor are they derived from, PHP, in whole or\nin part.\n\n> I know this is not strictly a 'Linux' issue but any help would be appreciated\n\nMicrosoft has very much made this a Linux issue - it has attempted to imply\nthat any company using GPL software must make everything it owns public and\nit must be true - that nice man from Microsoft wouldn't lie, would he ?\n\n\n\nNiall\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"

We aren't debating whether the thief is better off -- he is. I'm not a lawyer either. I played one on TV once but I didn't play a very good one and they canceled it after the first episode ... The situtation I described came from my recollection of Epstein's 'Takings'. He was specifically rejecting the idea of absolute property right found in Liberation theology and was using the idea -- that in an emergency where my life depends upon it I'm entitled to violate your property rights and (more) you are forbidden from using unreasonable force to defend them (particularly if you aren't around). Maybe I did get it all wrong, but that particular recollection is relatively strong precisely because it gave a good reason why my libertarian theology needed to be modified. He was also analyzing what the common law had come up with, which might not be the statuatory law in a particular jurisdiction. > -----Original Message----- > From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of > Russell Turpin > Sent: Monday, August 12, 2002 2:15 PM > To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org > Subject: RE: David Friedman: Mail Me the Money! > > John Hall: > >The case against theft also acknowledges that the value to the thief is > >often far less than the value to the victim.

    "body_text": "A while ago I asked what other packages I should optomize for Pentium. One person answered GlibC. This got me thinking about GCC itself, so I asked on another list and got a few answers, most were \"don't even think about it\" but a few suggested GCC and one pointed me to Linux From Scratch. After having a good search around the lfs site, I've decided I'm going to give it a whirl. I've got a spare box and loads of free time, so why not ;-) The lfs site, however warns NOT to use optimizations when compiling GCC or GlibC? A quick google found PGCC, a Pentium optimizing patch for GCC, but the site does not seem to have been updated in quite some time? So, my general plan, and I'm taking my time with this: Partition the hard drive for the lfs set-up with 4 partitions, /, /usr, /var and /home. Install a base Debian system into the /home partition so I can build the rest of the system into the other partitions. Using Debian, build the initial packages into the / and /usr partitions. I'll try to optimize GCC and GlibC in this first stage. chroot to the / partition and re-build the base packages for shared libs. strip de-bugging from the binaries and change the boot so the system boot from / rather than /home, then move /home to it's proper partition. All going well, I should now have a full base Linux system running that is fully optimized for my PentiumMMX including GCC and GlibC. Now I can build zlib and then X, again optimizing. And I can follow this with the various graphics libs, qt lib and finally KDE. If all goes well, I will probably repeate this for my Dual system, once I can find a match for the slot1 550Mhz PIII Iv'e got. I might even be tempted to write this up for the site.

What, in RedHat, provides OpenGL? The X server itself does (or does not, depending on your driver). There is a software fallback called Mesa compiled in the X server, which is used as a fallback.

That doesn't matter. What does matter is that they were going on phenotypes, and didn't engineer the genetics. That example makes a good case for natural selection, but not for artificial. (do \"married people live longer\" because of the benefits of matrimony, or because acceptable health is one of the qualities selected for in spouses?) Of course, if there are FoRKs with six or fewer biological great grandparents (or who are offspring of Wilt) I should eat my words; otherwise, the micro/macro distinction seems much more relevant. -Dave > I guess that the reason that I disagree is that some groups arguing > against any checks on genetic engineering use that same argument - > \"we've been doing it since prehistory, so we don't need to apply any > caution today\". One can also view that argument as a case for checks: livestock owners have, over a period of millenia, altered the genetics of their herds to be dumber, meatier, and more tolerant of industrial living, so if caution is in order, they are some of the least likely people to volunteer it. http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",

Is it possible to get some sort of low- end internal tape / other solution that could be used to back up approx. 40 Gigs of data or am I just dreaming? My ISP does offer backups at extra cost but the only problem with that is, well, the extra cost. What I was hoping to do was to install some kind of internal tape device, then swap tapes round every month, so I had an onsite backup of say the last 24 hours and an offsite backup of the last month. Is this feasible? I'm beginning to think it isn't. External devices are not an option as part of the charge for colocation is rackspace.

I tried installing RedHat 7.3. It just didn't want to know about the graphics card. I's an onboard Intel DVMT chip. No dedicated memory, it takes it from the onboard RAM. I was wondering if anybody had gotton these machines and had any luck getting this graphics card working? When this graphics card didn't work, I installed a PCI Diamond Stealth 64 VRAM card. Xconfigurator auto-detected this and my 21\" SUN monitor no problem but whenever it tries to test the configuration it fails and the screen is left with a blue background and all of the text is blue. Does anybody have any idea what the problem is or how to fix it?

But this time he's several years behind. The idea of using epostage to stop spam has been discussed quite a bit. The problem is how to get over the adoption hump. Until most people are taking one form of epostage, most people don't have enough incentive to download and install something that allows them to pay it. Until most people are set up to pay it, any form of epostage I require closes my mailbox to unknown senders from whom I want to receive mail. And even from known senders. Giving someone my email address doesn't automatically put them in my white list. Hashcash tries to lower the adoption barrier by removing the need to pay money for epostage. Instead, the sender burns processing time on his computer, answering a cryptographically hard challenge. But even this requires set-up. There is inadequate incentive to do so until there is a standard mechanism, but no standard mechanism is born until a significant fraction of the market has taken that first step. It may take government action, to institute an effective epostage standard! I think the better idea is to require that people off your white list \"hand sign\" email to you. A couple of companies are now trying to implement this. An email sender, if not on your white list, must respond to a verification email or go to a website, by a process that is very simply for a human sender, but difficult for a spammer to automate. Where epostage requires a standard mechanism, a variety of mechanisms for \"hand signing\" would frustrate spammers while making it no more difficult for legitimate senders. I'm hoping Eudora and some of the other big mail clients incorporate this kind of feature. The advantage to putting this in the mail client is that the required \"hand sign\" can be personalized: \"Your attempt to email David Friedman is blocked until you fill in the blank: The Incredible ______ Machine.\" It will be a long time before spammers have a process that defeats millions of personal challenges. On the other hand, I have a hack in mind that would work a large percentage of the time. But I'm not telling. If spammers did figure out such hacks, people would then improve their challenges. Yeah, this would lead to another arms race, and spam would leak through to the unwitting. But this arms race is one that helps spammers identify and target the part of the population whose challenges are sub-par, which is their natural prey. People like David aren't in the market for herbal Viagra or back alley debt consolidation. Since David is an anarchist, I'm surprised he didn't point out that spam is the result of government. The government is ineffective at preventing spam, but it DOES prevent individuals and ISPs from taking retribution against spammers. _________________________________________________________________ MSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: http://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",

But this time he's\nseveral years behind. The idea of using epostage\nto stop spam has been discussed quite a bit. The\nproblem is how to get over the adoption hump.\nUntil most people are taking one form of epostage,\nmost people don't have enough incentive to download\nand install something that allows them to pay it.\nUntil most people are set up to pay it, any form of\nepostage I require closes my mailbox to unknown\nsenders from whom I want to receive mail. And even\nfrom known senders. Giving someone my email address\ndoesn't automatically put them in my white list.\n\nHashcash tries to lower the adoption barrier by\nremoving the need to pay money for epostage.\nInstead, the sender burns processing time on his\ncomputer, answering a cryptographically hard\nchallenge. But even this requires set-up. There is\ninadequate incentive to do so until there is a\nstandard mechanism, but no standard mechanism is\nborn until a significant fraction of the market\nhas taken that first step. It may take government\naction, to institute an effective epostage\nstandard!\n\nI think the better idea is to require that people\noff your white list \"hand sign\" email to you. A\ncouple of companies are now trying to implement\nthis. An email sender, if not on your white list,\nmust respond to a verification email or go to a\nwebsite, by a process that is very simply for a\nhuman sender, but difficult for a spammer to\nautomate. Where epostage requires a standard\nmechanism, a variety of mechanisms for \"hand\nsigning\" would frustrate spammers while making it\nno more difficult for legitimate senders. I'm\nhoping Eudora and some of the other big mail\nclients incorporate this kind of feature. The\nadvantage to putting this in the mail client is\nthat the required \"hand sign\" can be personalized:\n\n  \"Your attempt to email David Friedman is\n  blocked until you fill in the blank: The\n  Incredible ______ Machine.\"\n\nIt will be a long time before spammers have a\nprocess that defeats millions of personal\nchallenges. On the other hand, I have a hack in\nmind that would work a large percentage of the\ntime. But I'm not telling. If spammers did figure\nout such hacks, people would then improve their\nchallenges. Yeah, this would lead to another\narms race, and spam would leak through to the\nunwitting. But this arms race is one that helps\nspammers identify and target the part of the\npopulation whose challenges are sub-par, which\nis their natural prey. People like David aren't\nin the market for herbal Viagra or back alley\ndebt consolidation.\n\nSince David is an anarchist, I'm surprised he\ndidn't point out that spam is the result of\ngovernment. The government is ineffective at\npreventing spam, but it DOES prevent individuals\nand ISPs from taking retribution against spammers.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: \nhttp://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"

It's not hard math - jpeg is a straight block-based DCT with quantisation - which is about the oldest image compression algorithm out there, and I think certainly predates 1986. So I really have no idea what they claim they've patented - doin DCT on 8x8 blocks of an image, quantising the resulting coefficients, or DCT in general?

Anyway, here's to ogg, and hopefully the future mpeg4-standard compression algorithm the project comes up with (fingers crossed). And I wouldn't worry about the jpeg thing - in addition the patent runs out next year, and I would suggest that having failed to protect their IP for 15 years, as (iirc) is their responsibility, their claim would probably never hold up in court.

However, when I was halfway literate in Tagalog, I learned that there is a specific word in that language (or was it another dialect?) for it: muta, pronounced \"MOO-ta\". Even though my Tagalog has faded greatly, I automatically use that word for \"eye goop\" when speaking English (how often does that happen?), mostly because it apparently filled a linguistic hole in my brain and therefore permanently wedged itself into my vocabulary. Not that this is important, but I've inadvertently adopted \"muta\" into my version of the English language as the word for \"eye goop\". Arguably better than \"smegma\" anyway.

Even though my Tagalog has faded greatly, I\nautomatically use that word for \"eye goop\" when speaking English (how\noften does that happen?), mostly because it apparently filled a\nlinguistic hole in my brain and therefore permanently wedged itself into\nmy vocabulary.\n\nNot that this is important, but I've inadvertently adopted \"muta\" into\nmy version of the English language as the word for \"eye goop\".  Arguably\nbetter than \"smegma\" anyway.\n\n(Definitely Friday...)\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"

Yeah, that would work, tho there are race conditions and likely/possible ugly side effects (eg unintentionally left-over comp files). I've ended up taking a very different route: TMDA (http://www.tmda.net). In particular I use TMDA outbound filters to add custom plus addresses to the messages I send to specific lists. For example, for the tmda-users list I want a From: address of claw+tmda@kanga.nu, so the relevant outbound filter is: to tmda-users@libertine.org ext=tmda which rewrites my From: header transparently. When I get next month's batch of password reminders from Mailman lists I'll be running about resubscribing to each list either with a standard plus address or a TMDA-based sender address (ie an address which only the list in question is able to send mail to). -+- Getting TMDA fully happy with nmh was a minor pain. Reasons: nmh, like MH, by default delivers outbound mail via SMTP to port 25 on a defined host. The port number cannot be configured (it calls getservbyname() which does a lookup against \"smtp\" in /etc/services). Ergo, you are constrained to use tell nmh to use tmda-sendmail instead of SMTP. Using sendmail as the delivery method under MH instead of SMTP is not recommended as is loses a number of useful bits of robustness in mail delivery failure modes. Further, when nmh is configured to use sendmail instead of SMTP nmh's whom tool calls sendmail as follows: .../sendmail/ -m -t -i -bv which creates problems: Postfix does not support \"-bv\" and returns in error Exim does not support \"-t\" with \"-bv\" and returns in error Don't mention Qmail. I won't use it. \"whom\" is far too useful as a component tool in MH to lose. It would be nice if someone gave the new crew working on nmh a shout about this. The \"-bv\" option to sendmail is pretty damned close to being Allman sendmail specific and thus unfriendly to other MTAs. Further there are many cases where it would be useful to configure a non-standard port to deliver outbound mail to via SMTP. nmh's current insistence on only using port 25 (or as specified in /etc/services) is a pain. I've worked out a hack to use TMDA with Exim while retaining nmh's \"whom\" support using Exim's system filter: 0) Make sure that the following options are set in ~/.tmda/config: DATADIR ALLOW_MODE_640 CRYPT_KEY_FILE FINGERPRINT 1) chgrp everything in and under ~/.tmda to group \"mail\". 2) Configure Exim as per the current TMDA HOW-TO. 3) Set the following options in exim.conf: message_filter = \"/etc/exim/filter\" message_filter_pipe_transport = address_pipe 4) /etc/exim/filter reads: # Exim filter testprint \"local_part: ${local_part: $h_From:}\" testprint \"domain: ${domain: $h_From:}\" if \"$h_X-tmda-fingerprint:\" is \"\" and \"${domain: $h_From:}\" is \"kanga.nu\" and \"${if exists {/home/${local_part:$h_From:}/.tmda} {true}{false}}\" is \"true\" then pipe \"/usr/bin/tmda-inject -c /home/${local_part:$h_From:}/.tmda/config\" finish endif Yes, that assumes that all user directories are under /home and that they use ~/.tmda/config instead of ~/.tmdarc. Hack appropriately for your setup. Basic explanation: Exim sends all outbound mail thru the system filter (if one is configured) before attempting delivery. The above system filter extracts the user from the From: address and pipes the message thru that user's TMDA setup via tmda-inject. The system filter runs as the same user as Exim, thus the requirement for the chgrp mail. If your Exim installation runs as a different user, chgrp as appropriate. It should be fairly easy to do something similar under Postfix, but I haven't investigated that end. Notes: This requires that all outbound mail that is to be processed with TMDA has a From: header which references a local user (suffixes are fine), and that the From: address is fully qualified with a known domain. If you're vhosting the above setup would be fairly trivial to extend for other domains and $HOME paths. I'm not vhosting on my desktop and so don't care. You could also qualify on envelope or other headers if you wish. A nice side effect of this approach for those running shared mail servers is that ALL users who have TMDA configs instantly get TMDA support for their outbound mail -- and in a manner that is less complex and less prone to end-user error than the typical TMDA configuration. Caveat Emptor. ObNote: I've also written a small patch against TMDA 0.58 to add a \"hold\" delivery method (identical to \"confirm\" except it sends no confirmation requests -- very useful for testing configs or doing silent sidetracking of mail). -- J C Lawrence ---------(*) Satan, oscillate my metallic sonatas. claw@kanga.nu He lived as a devil, eh? http://www.kanga.nu/~claw/ Evil is a name of a foeman, as I live. _______________________________________________ Exmh-users mailing list Exmh-users@redhat.com https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users",

I'm aware that maybe more publicity surrounding some and certain agencies have been granted more funding, but I'd like to see some data which shows if these are increasing or not. Why? Well, it seems to me if we were going to get hit, the one that does it may have been part of a larger swarm or cluster which has over the years increased the distance between the rocks. Like the Schumaker Levy-9, which had multiple rocks all impacting at different times, others may have this same type of design and could be in different stages of increasing distance from one another. Also to consider is if SL-9 was on course for earth, would we get hit by all rocks or only one because the earth is a much smaller target than Jupiter? So, my theory is that if these near earth rocks are increasing so does our chance of discovering the last three were part of a swarm of 15 of which 10, 11 and 12 may hit.

On the employment situation... it seems that a lot of applied cryptographers are currently unemployed (Tim Dierks, Joseph, a few ex-colleagues, and friends who asked if I had any leads, the spate of recent \"security consultant\" .sigs, plus I heard that a straw poll of attenders at the codecon conference earlier this year showed close to 50% out of work). Are there any more definitive security industry stats? Are applied crypto people suffering higher rates of unemployment than general application programmers? (From my statistically too small sample of acquaintances it might appear so.) If this is so, why is it? - you might think the physical security push following the world political instability worries following Sep 11th would be accompanied by a corresponding information security push -- jittery companies improving their disaster recovery and to a lesser extent info sec plans. - governments are still harping on the info-war hype, national information infrastructure protection, and the US Information Security Czar Clarke making grandiose pronouncements about how industry ought to do various things (that the USG spent the last 10 years doing it's best to frustrate industry from doing with it's dumb export laws) - even Microsoft has decided to make a play of cleaning up it's security act (you'd wonder if this was in fact a cover for Palladium which I think is likely a big play for them in terms of future control points and (anti-)competitive strategy -- as well as obviously a play for the home entertainment system space with DRM) However these reasons are perhaps more than cancelled by: - dot-com bubble (though I saw some news reports earlier that though there is lots of churn in programmers in general, that long term unemployment rates were not that elevated in general) - perhaps security infrastructure and software upgrades are the first things to be canned when cash runs short? - software security related contract employees laid off ahead of full-timers? Certainly contracting seems to be flat in general, and especially in crypto software contracts look few and far between. At least in the UK some security people are employed in that way (not familiar with north america). - PKI seems to have fizzled compared to earlier exaggerated expectations, presumably lots of applied crypto jobs went at PKI companies downsizing. (If you ask me over use of ASN.1 and adoption of broken over complex and ill-defined ITU standards X.500, X.509 delayed deployment schedules by order of magnitude over what was strictly necessary and contributed to interoperability problems and I think significantly to the flop of PKI -- if it's that hard because of the broken tech, people will just do something else.) - custom crypto and security related software development is perhaps weighted towards dot-coms that just crashed. - big one probably: lack of measurability of security -- developers with no to limited crypto know-how are probably doing (and bodging) most of the crypto development that gets done in general, certainly contributing to the crappy state of crypto in software. So probably failure to realise this issue or perhaps just not caring, or lack of financial incentives to care on the part of software developers. Microsoft is really good at this one. The number of times they re-used RC4 keys in different protocols is amazing! Other explanations? Statistics? Sample-of-one stories? Adam -- yes, still employed in sofware security industry; and in addition have been doing crypto consulting since 97 (http://www.cypherspace.net/) if you have any interesting applied crypto projects; reference commissions paid. http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",

Are applied\ncrypto people suffering higher rates of unemployment than general\napplication programmers?  (From my statistically too small sample of\nacquaintances it might appear so.)\n\nIf this is so, why is it?\n\n- you might think the physical security push following the world\npolitical instability worries following Sep 11th would be accompanied\nby a corresponding information security push -- jittery companies\nimproving their disaster recovery and to a lesser extent info sec\nplans.\n\n- governments are still harping on the info-war hype, national\ninformation infrastructure protection, and the US Information Security\nCzar Clarke making grandiose pronouncements about how industry ought\nto do various things (that the USG spent the last 10 years doing it's\nbest to frustrate industry from doing with it's dumb export laws)\n\n- even Microsoft has decided to make a play of cleaning up it's\nsecurity act (you'd wonder if this was in fact a cover for Palladium\nwhich I think is likely a big play for them in terms of future control\npoints and (anti-)competitive strategy -- as well as obviously a play\nfor the home entertainment system space with DRM)\n\nHowever these reasons are perhaps more than cancelled by:\n\n- dot-com bubble (though I saw some news reports earlier that though\nthere is lots of churn in programmers in general, that long term\nunemployment rates were not that elevated in general)\n\n- perhaps security infrastructure and software upgrades are the first\nthings to be canned when cash runs short?  \n\n- software security related contract employees laid off ahead of\nfull-timers?  Certainly contracting seems to be flat in general, and\nespecially in crypto software contracts look few and far between.  At\nleast in the UK some security people are employed in that way (not\nfamiliar with north america).\n\n- PKI seems to have fizzled compared to earlier exaggerated\nexpectations, presumably lots of applied crypto jobs went at PKI\ncompanies downsizing.  (If you ask me over use of ASN.1 and adoption\nof broken over complex and ill-defined ITU standards X.500, X.509\ndelayed deployment schedules by order of magnitude over what was\nstrictly necessary and contributed to interoperability problems and I\nthink significantly to the flop of PKI -- if it's that hard because of\nthe broken tech, people will just do something else.)\n\n- custom crypto and security related software development is perhaps\nweighted towards dot-coms that just crashed.\n\n- big one probably: lack of measurability of security -- developers\nwith no to limited crypto know-how are probably doing (and bodging)\nmost of the crypto development that gets done in general, certainly\ncontributing to the crappy state of crypto in software.  So probably\nfailure to realise this issue or perhaps just not caring, or lack of\nfinancial incentives to care on the part of software developers.\nMicrosoft is really good at this one.  The number of times they\nre-used RC4 keys in different protocols is amazing!\n\n\nOther explanations?  Statistics?  Sample-of-one stories?\n\nAdam\n--\nyes, still employed in sofware security industry; and in addition have\nbeen doing crypto consulting since 97 (http://www.cypherspace.net/) if\nyou have any interesting applied crypto projects; reference\ncommissions paid.\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"

Fine - nobody can oblige SuSE to do anything other than put up the ftp version, but surely they can't prevent a CD owner from burning a copy and giving it to me?

Nobody can oblige them to give away anything other than ftp - I'm not asking for that. I'm asking for somebody who has Linux (GPL'ed) to burn a copy for me and give it to me in exchange for a reasonable consideration (say, the price of the CDs and a bottle of Frascati or a couple of pints?). What does the GPL mean now? I don't want their 60 days of free email support or anything similar (if I did, I would pay for it).

    "body_text": "I rigged this up for testing before I commit to a sitewide rollout of Spamassassin as an SMTP relay. It is more work, but it avoids sitewide changes in mail delivery during the early stages of testing. On the Exchange server... (mail.yourdomain.com) Create a new, private SMTP address (nomorespam@yourdomain.com) for the mailbox you want to protect. Remove the old address. Create a \"custom recipient\" with the old SMTP address (spammedalot@yourdomain.com). Create another custom recipient pointing at a local user on the Spamassassin box (killspam@filtermail.yourdomain.com). Set the first custom recipient to forward all mail to the second custom recipient. (must forward to another address in the Exchange directory) On the Spamassassin box... (filtermail.yourdomain.com) Set up a dummy user, in this case \"killspam\" Give killspam a .forward file pointing to the final recipient's new, private smtp address back on the Exchange server. So the message flow is like this: Mail arrives on the Exchange server mail.yourdomain.com for spammedalot@yourdomain.com spammedalot@commonwealth.com forwards it to killspam@filtermail.yourdomain.com Following the .forward file, the e-mail is then forwarded to nomorespam@yourdomain.com Wowie Zowie it works. The first address I protected was myself, the second one I protected was postmaster. As you can see, you must create two custom recipients in Exchange and one dummy account with a .forward file on the spam filter box for each address you want to protect. Like I said, it is more work, but until I am done load-testing, this is the way it will stay. -jake ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Spamassassin-talk mailing list Spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk",

(mail.yourdomain.com)\nCreate a new, private SMTP address (nomorespam@yourdomain.com) for the\nmailbox you want to protect. Remove the old address.\n\nCreate a \"custom recipient\" with the old SMTP address\n(spammedalot@yourdomain.com). Create another custom recipient pointing at a\nlocal user on the Spamassassin box (killspam@filtermail.yourdomain.com).\n\nSet the first custom recipient to forward all mail to the second custom\nrecipient. (must forward to another address in the Exchange directory)\n\nOn the Spamassassin box... (filtermail.yourdomain.com)\nSet up a dummy user, in this case \"killspam\"\nGive killspam a .forward file pointing to the final recipient's new, private\nsmtp address back on the Exchange server.\n\nSo the message flow is like this:\n\nMail arrives on the Exchange server mail.yourdomain.com for\nspammedalot@yourdomain.com\n\nspammedalot@commonwealth.com forwards it to\nkillspam@filtermail.yourdomain.com\n\nFollowing the .forward file, the e-mail is then forwarded to\nnomorespam@yourdomain.com\n\n\nWowie Zowie it works. The first address I protected was myself, the second\none I protected was postmaster.\n\nAs you can see, you must create two custom recipients in Exchange and one\ndummy account with a .forward file on the spam filter box for each address\nyou want to protect. Like I said, it is more work, but until I am done\nload-testing, this is the way it will stay.\n\n-jake\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\nWelcome to geek heaven.\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\n_______________________________________________\nSpamassassin-talk mailing list\nSpamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk\n\n\n"

If this is new behaviour in a previously working network, what did you do to it? Test the cables by switching which machine has which. Test the hub ports by switching cables around.

If it is spam, then don't send the ) body, 4 signatures, etc, just up the \"rating\" for that individual spam. razor-report only sends the body if the server does not have a copy already.

    "body_text": "Hi, Four of the IE nameservers are publishing out of date DNS information. The four listed below are publishing the IE zone from last Friday. They are six days behind reality. 192.16.202.11 NS.EU.NET. 192.93.0.4 NS2.NIC.FR. 198.133.199.102 GNS1.DOMAINREGISTRY.IE. 198.133.199.103 GNS2.DOMAINREGISTRY.IE. The upshot of this is that correct DNS resolution for IE DNS data that has been added or updated since last Friday is going to be intermittant. If you're lucky your resolver will query one of the five nameservers that are publishing an up-to-date zone. Unfortunately, five out of nine aren't good odds. Don't forget, if you lose the gamble your resolver is going to cache the bad data for up to two days. If you're a user of BIND 8 or BIND 9 you could add blackhole { 192.16.202.11; 192.93.0.4; 198.133.199.102; 198.133.199.103; }; to your named.conf and restart BIND to avoid query the bad nameservers. This will prevent _any_ queries to those servers. Putting 16.1.0.18 204.123.2.18 16.1.0.19 192.111.39.100 212.17.32.2 193.1.142.2 in /service/dnscache/root/servers/ie and restarting dnscache will have the same result for dnscache users.

If you're lucky your resolver will query one of the five\nnameservers that are publishing an up-to-date zone. Unfortunately, five\nout of nine aren't good odds.\n\nDon't forget, if you lose the gamble your resolver is going to cache\nthe bad data for up to two days.\n\nIf you're a user of BIND 8 or BIND 9 you could add\n\n\tblackhole {\n\t\t192.16.202.11;\n\t\t192.93.0.4;\n\t\t198.133.199.102;\n\t\t198.133.199.103;\n\t};\n\nto your named.conf and restart BIND to avoid query the bad nameservers.\nThis will prevent _any_ queries to those servers.\n\nPutting\n\n\t16.1.0.18\n\t204.123.2.18\n\t16.1.0.19\n\t192.111.39.100\n\t212.17.32.2\n\t193.1.142.2\n\nin /service/dnscache/root/servers/ie and restarting dnscache will\nhave the same result for dnscache users.\n\n\nATB,\njames\n_______________________________________________\nIrish Internet Users mailing list\nIrish Internet Users@iiu.taint.org\nhttp://iiu.taint.org/mailman/listinfo/iiu\n\n\n"

    "body_text": "I have a situation with a small network as follows: A number of client workstations which are running VMware, each of which will run a local copy of Samba (not the VMware autoinstalled version) to let VMware access local linux disks. An NIS/NFS server which will also run Samba to allow the VMware clients access to its filesystems. How can I set things up so that all the VMware clients (all running 'doze 98, possibly being upgraded in future to W2K) authenticate against the NIS server's Samba ? I have read the Samab documentation in large quantities down through the years but as I've never wanted to do anything like this, I never paid much attention to all the stuff about domain controllers etc. which I presume is what I will need to have running here. I would also like, if at all possible, to have synchronisation of passwords between the NIS domain and the NIS server's Samba with minimal manual intervention. Ideas, accompanied by annotated Samba configration files :-) , gratefully received.

How about something like: cd {dest.dir} tar -C {source.dir} cf - | tar xf - tar cf - will pipe the tar file to stdout and tar xf - will untar it.

A lot of C++ programmers, myself included, were /not/ complaining about gcc's stricter adherence to the specification (which, by the way, a lot of kernel programmers complain about with gcc 3.x -- at least, the patch authors I've talked to hate gcc 3) -- gcc \"2.96\" had a lot of bugs. A lot. It crashed on me many times while working on my projects. Later \"versions\" of \"2.96\" fixed this, but it was well after 3.0 was released that it finally seemed reasonably stable -- and at that point, I just wanted to use 3.0, so I did.

True, but that's the thinking of today, that the company mailserver can be closed to you from the outside; because as it is today you can use any mail- server that you've got access to. If there's a good reason for setting it up they won't be that lazy in the future. > However, requiring mailservers to sign the Received: header... That > could be useful.

A simple RFC could fix that today, either using a new header or extending the Received-header with a code/value that the server later on can verify; maybe something like this: Received2: Date: [date]; Local: sub.dom2.tld (IP#2); Remote: sub.dom3.tld (IP#3); Env-id: <the.usual.stuff@sub.dom1.tld> Code: [cache#, salted hashvalue, rsa or other signature] And then you have the two optional From and To, only added by the sending server that's identified the local sender or the server accepting mail for a certain user (to verify that it did really come via that server, in case you forward it using procmail or something like it). You of course would need some standard for how to check these headers. Not perfect, but better than what we have today. /Tony -- # Per scientiam ad libertatem! // Through knowledge towards freedom! # # Genom kunskap mot frihet! =*= (c) 1999-2002 tony@svanstrom.com =*= # perl -e'print$_{$_} for sort%_=`lynx -source svanstrom.com/t`' ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven. http://thinkgeek.com/sf _______________________________________________ Spamassassin-talk mailing list Spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-talk",

If there's a good reason for setting it up\nthey won't be that lazy in the future.\n\n> However, requiring mailservers to sign the Received: header...  That\n> could be useful.

And no need to travel out to anywhere near the meteor, G> either. Just the moon. Yeah, right. Considering the Genesis project just won an award for figuring out (surprise, surprise) that N-body problems with 10+ bodies yield some interesting synergetic surprises ... suffice it to say that the issue has been hashed over in sci.astro many, many times, since even long before Hollywood posed the problem, and the very best advice is still \"duck and cover\"; if you are still going to nudge anything, though, I'd nudge the rock (the one the size of a small town) as you're less likely to re-define global agriculture that way. 'Course, you're gonna have this problem of distributing the force over a large enough surface area that it translates into a resillient compression wave instead of a knifeblade/diamond faultline split. It's also not a game of billiards, but a 6+ dimensional collision problem (space, time, spin, temp, maybe electromag too if there's any heavy metals in it, and there often is) complete with relativistic effects and everything. Hands up all those with experience subjecting blackboxed alien geology to sustained forces in excess of 100 megatons (10% of it's own momentum). I'm going to trust the US Army with this when they can't even /find/ more than a few hundred Al Queda in a desert? Oh, another problem: It's not the only rock out there. We're just getting better at spotting them.

Why not... it's just that sometimes it gets a bit more confusing in the spec file since you have to change the \"Source:\" as well as \"%setup\" to reflect the name changes. But it might also sometimes be even easier the way you suggest, if the entire package contains only references to the final version and that only the archive name has a \"pr1\" or \"beta6\" in it for example.

I don't know Mutt, to be honest, but the KDE mail client \"KMail\" can do this very neatly - you set up multiple \"Identity\" profiles, each with a distinct email address (and other things if desired, like a GPG key and a signature). You can then set up KMail to use various identities automatically when replying to messages which match a particular pattern, or which are in a particular folder, etc. It's all very cool, and it works very nicely. But I still don't know how to do it in Mutt.

    "body_text": "-------------------------------------------------------------------------- What is MIME? MIME stands for \"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions\". It is the standard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the world-wide Internet email system. Typical uses of MIME include sending images, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part of the file. MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a recipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. How can I read a MIME message? Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use which do not understand MIME messages. However, there are a growing number of mail programs that have MIME support built-in. (One popular MIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the University of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z) In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation capability in their Internet gateway products. However, even if you do not have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is still hope! There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME message. One of the more versatile is called \"munpack\". It was developed at Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/. There are versions available for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems. For compabibility with older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also decode messages in split-uuencoded format. Does MIME replace UUENCODE? Yes. UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so that they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical limitations and interoperability problems. MIME uses a more robust encoding called \"Base64\" which has been carefully designed to survive the message transformations made by certain email gateways. How can I learn more about MIME? The MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via anonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including: o US East Coast Address: ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10) o US West Coast Address: ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32) o Pacific Rim Address: munnari.oz.au (128.250.1.21) o Europe Address: nic.nordu.net (192.36.148.17) Look for the file /rfc/rfc1521.txt Another source of information is the Internet news group \"comp.mail.mime\", which includes a periodic posting of a \"Frequently Asked Questions\" list. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",

For those designers, inspired by research conducted at nearby Caltech, clocks are for wimps. The Fulcrum Microsystems Inc. design team isn't the first to propose an asynchronous processor, but president and chief executive officer Robert Nunn wants to be the first to take a clockless, fire-breathing processor mainstream. \"We really deal with an asynchronous world,\" he said. \"We only make it synchronous for our own convenience.\" This is the kind of stuff that many in the processor industry would consider lunatic fringe, too weird for conservative embedded-systems designers. But the young processor company and more than a dozen others like it are anchored in the mainstream courtesy of the MIPS instruction-set architecture. More and more, MIPS is becoming the choice for maverick processor design teams seeking a place at the high end by fielding unorthodox devices. And if Motorola and IBM in the PowerPC camp aren't careful, they could see their performance leadership in the high-end embedded-processor market snatched away by some of these upstarts. In Austin, Texas, meanwhile, designers at another MIPS house, Intrinsity Inc., aren't prepared to ditch the clock. But they are putting a new spin on some old tricks such as giving each gate its own clock and then letting them overlap. Using such sleight of hand, the company hopes to soon deliver RISC-based processors that run at an eye-popping 2 GHz and consume just 10 to 15 watts. Fulcrum, Intrinsity and their brethren may once have been written off as interesting experiments, backed by venture capitalists who overlooked some of the finer details, like software compatibility. What lends them respectability is MIPS. Theirs for the asking One reason young processor companies seem to be flocking to the platform is that its steward, MIPS Technologies Inc., has no qualms about licensing the instruction-set architecture (ISA), provided that the licensee agrees to meet a software-compatibility test suite. By contrast, processor-core rival ARM Ltd. has granted this privilege to just two of its many licensees, Intel and Motorola. And so far, the two PowerPC vendors, IBM Corp. and Motorola Inc., have rebuffed most requests to license that architecture, with the notable exception being FPGA vendor Xilinx Inc., which has licensed the 405 PowerPC from IBM. The MIPS ISA is also one of the simplest forms of reduced-instruction-set computing around, which tends to make it attractive to processor designers interested in extending the architecture. It was this and the wide availability of tools and software that drew Intrinsity to MIPS, even though the company is aiming at PowerPC sockets, as evidenced by its decision to adopt the RapidIO interface instead of HyperTransport, which has been favored by MIPS vendors. Good fit \"It's a nice, clean architecture and has an open model that allows us to add instructions,\" said Paul Nixon, chief executive officer of Intrinsity. \"You also get all the third-party tools that very easily fit into our base of platforms.\" There was a time when this openness was seen as a liability for MIPS. In the mid-1990s, before MIPS was spun out from Silicon Graphics Inc., the instruction set lacked a multiply-add instruction, so some MIPS vendors took it upon themselves to create their own. The problem was that this broke many of the development tools, causing headaches for compiler vendors like Green Hills Software Inc. \"We went to MIPS and said we have 20 different compiler variants and it's embarrassing,\" said Craig Franklin, vice president of engineering at Green Hills and a respected microprocessor industry veteran. Franklin also wasn't shy about telling MIPS it needed to revamp its embedded application binary interface. \"We went to MIPS and said we've done a dozen EABIs, let's clean up yours,\" he said. MIPS took the advice and wasted little time clamping down on architectural deviations, observers said. But the MIPS camp still has to live with a legacy of incompatible chips in the field. \"To its credit, MIPS quickly caught on,\" said Jim Turley, a microprocessor industry analyst. \"Going forward, MIPS is maintaining good control but they are still haunted by incompatibility among multiples.\" If the biggest risk to the MIPS camp is fragmentation, then the PowerPC camp has the opposite problem: architectural confinement. Though the PowerPC architecture carries the cachet of household names Motorola and IBM, these are essentially the only two companies that provide PowerPCs. It's not for lack of interest. Rather, the companies have been reluctant to cede control over the architecture. This could wind up hurting the PowerPC cause, though. \"To get a PowerPC license is impossible or very expensive,\" Green Hills' Franklin said. \"Tactically this may have been a mistake. If you're a Japanese company, all things being equal, you'd rather buy from another Japanese company.\" Analyst Turley, too, thinks the PowerPC camp will only stand to gain by licensing the architecture. \"It's all about software compatibility and tool support. The more you can proliferate the architecture the better you're going to do,\" he said. \"I don't think Motorola and IBM can address the entire market by themselves.\" There's a chance that this could change. IBM, for its part, is in the process of planning an expansion strategy for PowerPC that may involve more licensing. Though it's unlikely the PowerPC camp will ever have the open licensing model of MIPS Technologies, MIPS processor vendors may have more than just two competitors to worry about. \"We're certainly not averse to [licensing],\" said Lisa Su, director of PowerPC products at IBM. \"The question is, how much do we do and who do we license to. There are various ways you could go, whether it's a hard core, soft core or licensing the ISA.\" But the fear of architectural fragmentation still looms large. \"We know that if we have different microarchitectures we have to do work on software compatibility,\" Su said. \"With MIPS there's a degree of fracturing. That may not always be a big problem, but if you go to other markets -- like consumer -- it becomes big. Our belief is there is a happy medium.\" Whatever path IBM takes it will act in its own best interest as a chip provider, not as a company that wants to hawk intellectual property. This is why the Xilinx licensing deal works for IBM: Big Blue is not so much interested in the royalties and fees it collects from Xilinx, but in the dual benefit of widening the appeal of the architecture and the revenue IBM generates from manufacturing the FPGAs for Xilinx in its own fabs. \"We're not trying to make money off of licensing,\" Su said. Manufacturing is probably one of the most powerful weapons that PowerPC vendors IBM and Motorola wield. Both have gussied up their high-end lines with copper interconnect and silicon-on-insulator technology, still rarities among chip makers. This has helped both companies design relatively low-power embedded processors running at 1 GHz that are shipping today. IBM did it using 0.13-micron design rules and a four-stage pipeline; Motorola is using 0.18-micron design rules and a seven-stage pipe. The companies say there's more performance headroom in store. \"When we get to 0.13 micron we'll get substantially faster,\" said Raj Handa, PowerPC and PowerQuicc marketing manager at Motorola. Proprietary processes Most MIPS processor vendors, by contrast, rely on mainstream foundries that haven't developed the more-exotic process technologies. And even though companies like Motorola are shifting more capacity to outside foundries, they're keeping their special process recipes in-house to juice up their high-performance devices. Lacking this capability, most MIPS processor vendors will have little choice but to come up with dazzling architectural feats to keep up their chops at the high end. It should become clear in the next year or so how some of the newer players measure up. Intrinsity hopes to field its 2-GHz processors by the end of the year. Fulcrum is shooting for an early 2003 introduction. \"We're going to shock the industry in terms of raw performance and speed-vs.-power performance,\" Fulcrum's Nunn said. \"We really want to change the way the world designs semiconductors.\" http://www.fulcrummicro.com/press/article_fastco_04-02.shtml The Pasadena startup machine By Alison Overholt April, 2002 There was a time when every dorm room, it seemed, was a startup waiting to happen. Throughout the 1990s, kids cobbled together business plans between classes, won funding, and jumped into business. Risk? What risk? Plunging into a new venture seemed all too easy. Ah, the fickleness of youth. These days, most of the kids are back in class. Venture capitalists say that they're seeing precious few proposals out of MIT, Stanford, and almost every other university, save one: the California Institute of Technology. In fact, Caltech says that it actually spun out the same number of startups in 2001 -- a poor time, needless to say, for new ventures -- as it did in the boom year of 1999. While startup enthusiasm has faded on most campuses, Caltech has blossomed into a robust new-company machine. This didn't happen by accident. During the past seven years, Caltech's Office of Technology Transfer has carefully developed a strategy for cultivating commerce. \"We focus on nurturing entrepreneurs scientifically more than other schools do,\" says Rich Wolfe, the office's associate director. That is, the university focuses more on the science itself than on the ensuing commercial opportunity. That's what grabbed Uri Cummings and Andrew Lines, two PhD students at Caltech who founded Fulcrum Microsystems in 2000. \"There is a pervasive philosophy at Caltech that no problem is unsolvable,\" Cummings says. \"There's a focus on scientific ingenuity that is thrilling to be around. Caltech has so many entrepreneurs because the school doesn't make it about business or focus on how much money they'll get out of it. Caltech is a catalyst, moving technology from the university out into industry, and students are thrilled to be a part of it.\" Before starting Fulcrum, Cummings and Lines worked for six years with Caltech computer-science professor Alain Martin on an asynchronous-circuit design for semiconductor chips. They ventured into commercialization while still in the throes of their doctoral program. That they could afford to do that points to another, more practical aspect to Caltech's approach. Other universities typically require entrepreneurs to pay up-front application and licensing fees for the use of technology patents. But Caltech believes that such payments stifle entrepreneurship, since young companies usually have little cash to spare. Instead, the school typically takes equity stakes in startups, and it defers collection of patent payments until fledgling companies are financially secure. For Caltech, it's a long-term bet. \"The reality is that universities rely far more on their endowments than they could on any fees to be collected from the initial licensing process,\" Wolfe says. \"So we seek a bite of the apple -- and we hope that if one of these entrepreneurs founds the next Intel, he'll not only share the equity but also bestow a gift on the university in remembrance that we took care of him when he was just getting started.\" Cummings and Lines may be in a position to do just that. Fulcrum has won about $20 million in venture funding amid the toughest venture market in recent history. Its founders have hired a credible CEO, Bob Nunn, who formerly ran Vitesse's telecom division, and hired 24 top students from their alma mater. And they've garnered rave reviews of their chip design from technology journals. One thing that Cummings and Lines haven't done yet: finished their degrees. Officially, both are now \"on leave.\" They may not be back. ---- aDaM@XeNT.CoM High-tech startups fail for only three reasons: stupidity, luck, and greed. Tip one for would-be entrepreneurs: Avoid stupid and unlucky people. If you are stupid or have bad luck, don't start a high-tech business. Tip two for would-be entrepreneurs: Do a product that you want to do, not one that they want you to do. Startup founders generally have only ideas, charisma, and equity to work with. Ideas and charisma are cheap, but equity is expensive. To make a start-up work, the founder has to divvy out parts of the business at just the right rate to keep everyone happy until the product is a success. Give away too much of your company too soon to a venture capitalist, to your co-workers, or even to yourself, and you risk running out of distributable shares before the product is done. And that probably means the product won't be done. Ever. Tip three for would-be entrepreneurs: Don't take venture funding too soon. If you are doing a software product, don't take venture money until you need it to introduce the product. Don't take venture money until you have used up all of your own money, your mother-in-law's money, and everything you can borrow. Bootstrap. Rent, don't buy. Don't hire people to do things you can contract out because contractors don't require stock options. As the founder, the man or woman with the grand plan, your function is to manage the distribution of your own holdings so that you end up with fewer shares but more wealth. Tip four for would-be entrepreneurs: Invite me to lunch. I'm a cheap date. -- Robert X. Cringely, http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20010614.html http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",

There are various ways you could go, whether it's a hard\ncore, soft core or licensing the ISA.\"\n\nBut the fear of architectural fragmentation still looms large. \"We know\nthat if we have different microarchitectures we have to do work on\nsoftware compatibility,\" Su said. \"With MIPS there's a degree of\nfracturing. That may not always be a big problem, but if you go to other\nmarkets -- like consumer -- it becomes big. Our belief is there is a\nhappy medium.\"\n\nWhatever path IBM takes it will act in its own best interest as a chip\nprovider, not as a company that wants to hawk intellectual\nproperty. This is why the Xilinx licensing deal works for IBM: Big Blue\nis not so much interested in the royalties and fees it collects from\nXilinx, but in the dual benefit of widening the appeal of the\narchitecture and the revenue IBM generates from manufacturing the FPGAs\nfor Xilinx in its own fabs. \"We're not trying to make money off of\nlicensing,\" Su said.\n\nManufacturing is probably one of the most powerful weapons that PowerPC\nvendors IBM and Motorola wield. Both have gussied up their high-end\nlines with copper interconnect and silicon-on-insulator technology,\nstill rarities among chip makers. This has helped both companies design\nrelatively low-power embedded processors running at 1 GHz that are\nshipping today. IBM did it using 0.13-micron design rules and a\nfour-stage pipeline; Motorola is using 0.18-micron design rules and a\nseven-stage pipe.\n\nThe companies say there's more performance headroom in store. \"When we\nget to 0.13 micron we'll get substantially faster,\" said Raj Handa,\nPowerPC and PowerQuicc marketing manager at Motorola.\n\nProprietary processes \n\nMost MIPS processor vendors, by contrast, rely on mainstream foundries\nthat haven't developed the more-exotic process technologies. And even\nthough companies like Motorola are shifting more capacity to outside\nfoundries, they're keeping their special process recipes in-house to\njuice up their high-performance devices.\n\nLacking this capability, most MIPS processor vendors will have little\nchoice but to come up with dazzling architectural feats to keep up their\nchops at the high end. It should become clear in the next year or so how\nsome of the newer players measure up.\n\nIntrinsity hopes to field its 2-GHz processors by the end of the\nyear. Fulcrum is shooting for an early 2003 introduction. \"We're going\nto shock the industry in terms of raw performance and speed-vs.-power\nperformance,\" Fulcrum's Nunn said. \"We really want to change the way the\nworld designs semiconductors.\"\n\n\n\nhttp://www.fulcrummicro.com/press/article_fastco_04-02.shtml\n\nThe Pasadena startup machine\nBy Alison Overholt\nApril, 2002  \n\nThere was a time when every dorm room, it seemed, was a startup waiting\nto happen. Throughout the 1990s, kids cobbled together business plans\nbetween classes, won funding, and jumped into business. Risk? What risk?\nPlunging into a new venture seemed all too easy.\n\nAh, the fickleness of youth. These days, most of the kids are back in\nclass. Venture capitalists say that they're seeing precious few\nproposals out of MIT, Stanford, and almost every other university, save\none: the California Institute of Technology.\n\nIn fact, Caltech says that it actually spun out the same number of\nstartups in 2001 -- a poor time, needless to say, for new ventures -- as\nit did in the boom year of 1999. While startup enthusiasm has faded on\nmost campuses, Caltech has blossomed into a robust new-company machine.\n\nThis didn't happen by accident. During the past seven years, Caltech's\nOffice of Technology Transfer has carefully developed a strategy for\ncultivating commerce. \"We focus on nurturing entrepreneurs\nscientifically more than other schools do,\" says Rich Wolfe, the\noffice's associate director. That is, the university focuses more on the\nscience itself than on the ensuing commercial opportunity.\n\nThat's what grabbed Uri Cummings and Andrew Lines, two PhD students at\nCaltech who founded Fulcrum Microsystems in 2000. \"There is a pervasive\nphilosophy at Caltech that no problem is unsolvable,\" Cummings\nsays. \"There's a focus on scientific ingenuity that is thrilling to be\naround. Caltech has so many entrepreneurs because the school doesn't\nmake it about business or focus on how much money they'll get out of\nit. Caltech is a catalyst, moving technology from the university out\ninto industry, and students are thrilled to be a part of it.\"\n\nBefore starting Fulcrum, Cummings and Lines worked for six years with\nCaltech computer-science professor Alain Martin on an\nasynchronous-circuit design for semiconductor chips. They ventured into\ncommercialization while still in the throes of their doctoral program.\n\nThat they could afford to do that points to another, more practical\naspect to Caltech's approach. Other universities typically require\nentrepreneurs to pay up-front application and licensing fees for the use\nof technology patents. But Caltech believes that such payments stifle\nentrepreneurship, since young companies usually have little cash to\nspare. Instead, the school typically takes equity stakes in startups,\nand it defers collection of patent payments until fledgling companies\nare financially secure.\n\nFor Caltech, it's a long-term bet. \"The reality is that universities\nrely far more on their endowments than they could on any fees to be\ncollected from the initial licensing process,\" Wolfe says. \"So we seek a\nbite of the apple -- and we hope that if one of these entrepreneurs\nfounds the next Intel, he'll not only share the equity but also bestow a\ngift on the university in remembrance that we took care of him when he\nwas just getting started.\"\n\nCummings and Lines may be in a position to do just that. Fulcrum has won\nabout $20 million in venture funding amid the toughest venture market in\nrecent history. Its founders have hired a credible CEO, Bob Nunn, who\nformerly ran Vitesse's telecom division, and hired 24 top students from\ntheir alma mater. And they've garnered rave reviews of their chip design\nfrom technology journals.\n\nOne thing that Cummings and Lines haven't done yet: finished their\ndegrees. Officially, both are now \"on leave.\" They may not be back.\n\n\n\n----\naDaM@XeNT.CoM\n\n\nHigh-tech startups fail for only three reasons: stupidity, luck, and greed. \n\nTip one for would-be entrepreneurs: Avoid stupid and unlucky people. If\nyou are stupid or have bad luck, don't start a high-tech business.\n\nTip two for would-be entrepreneurs: Do a product that you want to do,\nnot one that they want you to do.\n\nStartup founders generally have only ideas, charisma, and equity to work\nwith. Ideas and charisma are cheap, but equity is expensive.  To make a\nstart-up work, the founder has to divvy out parts of the business at\njust the right rate to keep everyone happy until the product is a\nsuccess. Give away too much of your company too soon to a venture\ncapitalist, to your co-workers, or even to yourself, and you risk\nrunning out of distributable shares before the product is done. And that\nprobably means the product won't be done. Ever.\n\nTip three for would-be entrepreneurs: Don't take venture funding too soon. \n\nIf you are doing a software product, don't take venture money until you\nneed it to introduce the product.  Don't take venture money until you\nhave used up all of your own money, your mother-in-law's money, and\neverything you can borrow.\n\nBootstrap. Rent, don't buy. Don't hire people to do things you can\ncontract out because contractors don't require stock options.\n\nAs the founder, the man or woman with the grand plan, your function is\nto manage the distribution of your own holdings so that you end up with\nfewer shares but more wealth.\n\nTip four for would-be entrepreneurs: Invite me to lunch. I'm a cheap date.\n\n  -- Robert X. Cringely, http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20010614.html\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"

[last message before I unsub] It's a very poor comparison. There is no question as to what Ebay's trust model is. It's completely transparent. The ratings and the feedback is there for all to see. Most importantly it relies on the individual to make the decision for themselves rather or not to trust a buyer/seller. Contrast this with TeS which utilizes \"sooper secret\" methodologies to determine rather or not a submitter is trusted or not and at what point something becomes spam at some level of \"confidence.\" The unfortunate thing is that in my experience Razor is an incredibly ineffective filter at this point. The spot checking I've done indicates about a 40% hit rate. Submissions I made a week ago still don't count as spam, apparently because I'm not trusted enough, or enough people haven't submitted the item, or some unknown combination thereof. Why anyone would continue to waste their time submitting items when they aren't being accepted due to a series of calculations which will not be shared is beyond me.

It's\ncompletely transparent. The ratings and the feedback is there for all to\nsee. Most importantly it relies on the individual to make the decision for\nthemselves rather or not to trust a buyer/seller.\n\nContrast this with TeS which utilizes \"sooper secret\" methodologies to\ndetermine rather or not a submitter is trusted or not and at what point\nsomething becomes spam at some level of \"confidence.\"\n\nThe unfortunate thing is that in my experience Razor is an incredibly\nineffective filter at this point. The spot checking I've done indicates about\na 40% hit rate. Submissions I made a week ago still don't count as spam,\napparently because I'm not trusted enough, or enough people haven't submitted\nthe item, or some unknown combination thereof. Why anyone would continue to\nwaste their time submitting items when they aren't being accepted due to\na series of calculations which will not be shared is beyond me.\n\nAny trust model that cannot survive public scrutiny isn't worth trusting IMHO.\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\\n                               Patrick Greenwell\n         Asking the wrong questions is the leading cause of wrong answers\n\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\ncell phone?

Risk: Critical Vendor Status: Patches Released. Reference: http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/022002.html Overview: We have discovered a serious vulnerability within the default version of PHP. Depending on the processor architecture it may be possible for a remote attacker to either crash or compromise the web server. Details: PHP 4.2.0 introduced a completely rewritten multipart/form-data POST handler. While I was working on the code in my role as PHP developer i found a bug within the way the mime headers are processed. A malformed POST request can trigger an error condition, that is not correctly handled. Due to this bug it could happen that an uninit- ialised struct gets appended to the linked list of mime headers. When the lists gets cleaned or destroyed PHP tries to free the pointers that are expected in the struct. Because of the lack of initialisation those pointers contain stuff that was left on the stack by previous function calls. On the IA32 architecture (aka. x86) it is not possible to control what will end up in the uninitialised struct because of the stack layout. All possible code paths leave illegal addresses within the struct and PHP will crash when it tries to free them. Unfortunately the situation is absolutely different if you look on a solaris sparc installation. Here it is possible for an attacker to free chunks of memory that are full under his control. This is most probably the case for several more non IA32 architectures. Please note that exploitability is not only limited to systems that are running malloc()/free() implementations that are known to be vulnerable to control structure overwrites. This is because the internal PHP memory managment implements its own linked list system that can be used to overwrite nearly arbitrary memory addresses. Proof of Concept: e-matters is not going to release the exploit for this vulnerability to the public. Vendor Response: 22th July 2002 - An updated version of PHP which fixes this vulnerability was released and can be downloaded at: http://www.php.net/downloads.php The vendor announcement is available at: http://www.php.net/release_4_2_2.php Recommendation: If you are running PHP 4.2.x you should upgrade as soon as possible, especially if your server runs on a non IA32 CPU. If you cannot upgrade for whatever reason the only way to workaround this, is to disable all kinds of POST requests on your server.

This is because the internal PHP memory\n   managment implements its own linked list system that can be used to\n   overwrite nearly arbitrary memory addresses.\n   \n\nProof of Concept:\n\n   e-matters is not going to release the exploit for this vulnerability to\n   the public.\n   \n\nVendor Response:\n\n   22th July 2002 - An updated version of PHP which fixes this \n                    vulnerability was released and can be downloaded at:\n\n                       http://www.php.net/downloads.php\n\n                    The vendor announcement is available at:\n\n                       http://www.php.net/release_4_2_2.php\n\n\nRecommendation:\n\n   If you are running PHP 4.2.x you should upgrade as soon as possible,\n   especially if your server runs on a non IA32 CPU. If you cannot upgrade\n   for whatever reason the only way to workaround this, is to disable all\n   kinds of POST requests on your server.  \n   \n   \nGPG-Key:\n\n   http://security.e-matters.de/gpg_key.asc\n    \n   pub  1024D/75E7AAD6 2002-02-26 e-matters GmbH - Securityteam\n   Key fingerprint = 43DD 843C FAB9 832A E5AB  CAEB 81F2 8110 75E7 AAD6\n\n\nCopyright 2002 Stefan Esser.

    "body_text": "TCPA and Palladium: Content Control for the Masses While security experts poke and jab at what bits and pieces of the TCPA and Palladium specs they can get ahold of, they have tended to focus on how they work and what they imply as far as concerns such as privacy and security go, or alternatively, in terms of how they would impact the functionality of the general purpose logic device. Analysts both favorable and unfavorable have been analyzing them from these standpoints, while paying much less attention to what the proposals imply from the standpoint of what content control itself really means. The most significant problem with TCPA and Palladium is not whether they may interfere with the power of the universal logic device, or whether they are effectual from the standpoint of privacy and security concerns, though these are all very important concerns. Rather, the fundamental problem they present is in the political premises that they hope to implement for the sake of the \"content industries.\" TCPA and Palladium are the technological realization of the concepts embodied in the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT), which only came into effect this past May 20th (with little public notice or fanfare, of course). The WPPT declares an unprecedented \"moral right\" of authors to control public uses of their works. *That's* the real game plan. TCPA and Palladium are simply content control for the masses. They constitute an effort to \"democratize\" content control under the concept of \"moral rights,\" encouraging the public to overlook the clear public interest issues raised by the specter of content control, and to confuse these issues with private interest issues such as privacy and security. They are an effort to get the public to jump on the bandwagon without adequate consideration of what's really on the line. In America, we have never supported the concept of \"moral rights\" which the WPPT professes. The US Constitution accords Congress the power to grant (or deny) exclusive rights to works and inventions for the purpose of promoting the progress of the useful arts and sciences, not for the purpose of rewarding the originality of creators -- though that result is obviously a consequence of exclusive rights statutes such as copyright law. Our Supreme Court explicitly articulates this distinction, and for very good reason. In America, we implicitly understand the distinction between expression, the aspect of works to which copyright statute applies, and the facts and ideas that make up a work, to which it does *not* apply. The reason for this is essential and unavoidable, and must be stated clearly and unequivocally at this juncture: information is free. It's not that it *wants* to be -- it *is* and it always has been. This fact is unassailable, however, unless we let come to pass a world that subscribes to \"universal content control\" for the sake of so-called \"moral rights\" implemented at the behest of narrow content industry interests. TCPA and Palladium are initiatives that hope to encourage the general public, and more specifically producers of information products in general, to identify content control with \"moral rights,\" blithely overlooking the real implications of information technology in a free society, and the long tradition of American jurisprudence upholding the freedom intrinsic to information, a freedom on which the prospects of information technology crucially depend.

A reasonable UI would have me enter my passphrase *at most* each time I launch my mail program -- never more than once per day, sometimes once per week.

Antimissile defense is designed to operate in ~LEO environment, and knocks out stuff by kinetic kill or nearby nuking (damage by neutron flux impacting the fissibles). It is *not* designed to apply a 100 MT warhead (we don't have these, and synchonous impact is even more out of question) detonate-on-impact to a 28 km/s rock or rubble target. A 100 MT warhead most assuredly will scarcely fragment a 2 km target in the few seconds left before the impact.

The anti-missile defense is about worse than useless in this case. The only way to protect is determining orbits at high precision and deflecting long-term.

In short yes. The more logic involved the longer the CPU is executing it. I.E. there is more logic executed (including NIC logic) when going down to the metal than when using lo. So how much logic is involved for each type of IPC (why are you limiting yourself to sockets? there are mutexes, shared mem, files, messages...).

He wanted to spade his potato garden, but it was very hard work. His only son, who would have helped him, was in Prison. The old man wrote a letter to his son and mentioned his predicament. Shortly, he received this reply, \"For heaven's sake Dad, don't dig up that garden, that's where I buried the GUNS!\" At 4 A.M. the next morning, a dozen police showed up and dug up the old man's entire garden, without finding any guns. Confused, the old man wrote another note to his son telling him what happened, and asking him what to do next. His son's reply was: \"Now plant your potatoes, Dad. It's the best I could do at this time.\" but better than that, just settle into this, courtesy of daypop: http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG02/yeung/actioncomics/cover.html -- Gary Lawrence Murphy <garym@teledyn.com> TeleDynamics Communications Inc Business Innovations Through Open Source Systems: http://www.teledyn.com \"Computers are useless.

I've now got an even faster method for elliptic-curve point counting, both pratically and asymptotically. It lifts a curve over a field of degree n in time O(n^(2+1/2+eps)), or O(n^(2+eps)) with precomputation. Before the best methods took O(n^(3+eps)) without precomputation, or O(n^(2+1/2+eps)) with it. The precomputation is done once per field, not per curve, and takes time O(n^(3+eps)). Here eps is an arbitrarily small number, hiding some logarithmic factors. After lifting, you compute a norm in time O(n^(2+1/3+eps)) to get the number of points on the curve. Here's an example over a 1009-bit field, without precomputation, using a 1 GHz Pentium III: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ > ./ecpc4 -d 1009 -j 0x123 INFO: -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- INFO: -=-=-=-=-= ECPC: Elliptic Curve Point Counting, made easy! =-=-=-=-=- INFO: -=-=-=-=-= v4.0.0.

Gabber, M. Jakobsson, Y. Matias, A. Mayer Bell in FC98. Online copy here: http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/27735.html (Look in the view or download section at the top right, it's availabile in at least .pdf and .ps formats). The framework they propose with proxies etc looks a lot like the current camram architecture, with a proof of work to get on a white list. They use target revokable email addresses (basically identical to the LWPA concept) to implement the white list. The resulting framework is essentially identical to what I proposed in recent message with: Subject: target revokable email addresses, and postage-free tokens Their idea of including the postage free-token in the email address, mirrors what is done in LWPA and makes the system exhibit smoother migration for non-users. eg. you can use varied sender addresses and it will still work, you can forward the email address to someone else and it will still work etc. They have some software architecture diagrams and suggestions for installing some of the proxies on a corporate gateway -- \"gatekeeper\" they call it.

Gabber, M. Jakobsson, Y. Matias, A. Mayer Bell\n\nin FC98.\n\nOnline copy here:\n\nhttp://citeseer.nj.nec.com/27735.html\n\n(Look in the view or download section at the top right, it's\navailabile in at least .pdf and .ps formats).\n\nThe framework they propose with proxies etc looks a lot like the\ncurrent camram architecture, with a proof of work to get on a white\nlist.  They use target revokable email addresses (basically identical\nto the LWPA concept) to implement the white list.\n\nThe resulting framework is essentially identical to what I proposed in\nrecent message with:\n\nSubject: target revokable email addresses, and postage-free tokens\n\nTheir idea of including the postage free-token in the email address,\nmirrors what is done in LWPA and makes the system exhibit smoother\nmigration for non-users.  eg. you can use varied sender addresses and\nit will still work, you can forward the email address to someone else\nand it will still work etc.\n\nThey have some software architecture diagrams and suggestions for\ninstalling some of the proxies on a corporate gateway -- \"gatekeeper\"\nthey call it.\n\nAdam\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTo unsubscribe, e-mail: camram-spam-unsubscribe@camram.org\nFor additional commands, e-mail: camram-spam-help@camram.org\n\n--- end forwarded text\n\n--- end forwarded text\n\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.

It's gonna be a gateway for a wireless network and will sit in my room (as my room is only spitting distance from the chimney where i'll be mounting the aerial) It has to be completely silent, or it'll do my nut. What do I need? I'll prob use a shitty p166 i have here, it doesnt have a fan, and I'm not worried about HD noise too much as it'll be idle mostly (should I be?) any info would be appreciated. I can't afford one of those lovely new shoebox size totally silent pcs and I cant use an old laptop as I have a pci wireless card and cable already bought (160$ or so) And where can I get a fanless psu? I know they exist because the lads at antefacto had them (lads, where can I get one?). Although I do remember a slight lack of metal box around the humongous voltage parts!

I would ask the members of SVLUG to hold off on attending the screening for the simple reason that I am trying to get REVOLUTION OS booked into the Camera 3 in San Jose, and I would prefer that SVLUG's members have a chance to see a nice 35mm print of the film. If my distributor is unable to book the film into a theater in the Bay Area, I promise that I will work with SVLUG to quickly set up a screening for its members. I realize there may be some members of SlugLUG who are unhappy that I originally requested that they not hold an unauthorized screening of REVOLUTION OS. There are several reasons why I made the request, and none of them have anything to do with me wanting to be a jerk. One SlugLUG member commented that it was odd that a movie about the Open Source movement would not be available for open viewings. Another SlugLUG member remarked that my request smacks of Bill Gates's Open Letter to Hobbyists. The bottomline is that I did make a film about the Open Source movement, but to assume that automatically means that the film is itself Open Sourced seems to be a little bit of a stretch. If I made a movie about the history of vegetarianism that would not automatically mean I'm a vegetarian. I simply thought Open Source and Free Software were compelling subjects worth exploring and documenting. As a result, I came to admire many aspects of the Open Source movement and chose to focus the documentary on the movement's positive history. However, I do not think I should be punished for telling the story of Free Software and Open Source by having my intellectual property misappropriated. More practically, my feelings about Open Sourcing REVOLUTION OS are abundantly clear when you see the explicit copyright notice at the end of the film's credits. I realize that making a videotape copy for personal use from a TV airing is considered fair use. I believe in a healthy fair use doctrine. However, there is a big difference between viewing your personal copy at home with a few friends and holding a publicly advertised screening on a university campus. So I freely admit my objection to unauthorized screenings of REVOLUTION OS does echo Bill Gates's letter. Personally, I believe that the creator of a piece of intellectual property should retain the choice to Open Source their IP. If the Open Source movement is not voluntary then it is really just piracy. One of the reasons I am concern with unauthorized group screenings of the film, is that my distributor is planning in a few weeks to begin selling VHS copies of the film for educational/institutional use with a license permitting noncommercial large group screenings. We hope to use the money from these sales to fund the authoring and replication of the DVD. I want to release the DVD as soon as possible, but I cannot afford to take on anymore REVOLUTION OS-related debt. Thus the importance of preserving the educational/institutional market. Frequently, I will read comments on Slashdot and other mailing lists that justify the piracy of music on the grounds that it benefits the artists and only hurts the greedy record labels. Well, in the case of REVOLUTION OS there is no multinational media conglomerate to punish. It's just me. I made and financed the film on my own. I have worked full-time for almost three years without a salary. The only way I will get out of debt and have a chance to make another film is if people seek out legal opportunities to view REVOLUTION OS. I truly appreciate the enthusiasm of the Open Source community for REVOLUTION OS, and I am grateful that people do want to see it. If you will just bare with me, I will figure out a way for all interested persons to legally view it. I hope the dust up over the unauthorized, and now authorized, screening at UC Santa Cruz has not inconvenienced anyone. Sincerely, J.T.S.

Prepare LILO to boot the new disk (Thanks to Rick Masters for helping with this.) We're assuming that LILO is installed on the hard disk's Master Boot Record (MBR); this seems to be the most common configuration. You want to install LILO on what's presently the second hard disk but will become the first hard disk. Edit the file /new-disk/etc/lilo.conf as follows: disk=/dev/hdb bios=0x80 # Tell LILO to treat the second # disk as if it were the first # disk (BIOS ID 0x80). boot=/dev/hdb # Install LILO on second hard # disk. map=/new-disk/boot/map # Location of \"map file\". install=/new-disk/boot/boot.b # File to copy to hard disk's # boot sector. prompt # Have LILO show \"LILO boot:\" # prompt. timeout=50 # Boot default system after 5 # seconds. (Value is in tenths of # seconds.) image=/new-disk/boot/vmlinuz # Location of Linux kernel. The # actual name may include a version # number, for example # \"vmlinuz-2.0.35\". label=linux # Label for Linux system. root=/dev/hda1 # Location of root partition on # new hard disk. Modify this as # appropriate for your system. # Note that you must use the name # of the future location, once the # old disk has been removed. read-only # Mount partition read-only at # first, to run fsck.

Hey, that thing is 2 km across and 28 km/s fast. There's nothing you can do just before the impact with a system that was designed to deal with tiny ballistic missiles, and largely by damaging them, not destroying them. Apart from twiddling with the surface albedo which might be not enough -- we currently don't have ion drives with enough power, or at least we can't develop and deploy them on time, so that only leaves you with nukes. Assymetrical repeated flash-evaporation (anything closer would risk fragmenting it) on rocks of unknown composition (could be a pile of rubble for all what we know) has never been tried yet, though. > I'm not holding my breath, but i'm not going to panic for something thats > a little under 17 years away, either. It is much more interesting whether you can kill enough of delta v for a capture. But here trying to brake a smaller object (say, few 100 m across) with final stage aerobraking would be far more useful.

While you can pick up heartbeat by Doppler radar, later tells it's realtime DSP on an array of SQIDs. Later they mention they use passive IR imaging and eye saccade evaluation.

So they claim terrorist intent translates in biosignatures they can pick up by close-distance passive telemetry, in realtime, with a very low number of false positives, while having no chance to calibrate, in the field. Right. Seems somebody is so awfully eager to pick up a slice of research grant pie from the heimatland securitate money they haven't even bothered to invent a plausible lie. http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",

Or stronger? > >Raw bits are OK, cooked bits are better. Oh. OK. These results don't help break EC crypto at all. With RSA, you pick a number with secret factors and to break the cryptosystem, you can factor the number. Due to fast sub-exponential algorithms for factoring, the number had better be 1024 bits at the very least (record = 524 bits). With EC, you pick a curve and pick points on the curve with secret discrete logarithm. To break the cryptosystem you can compute a discrete log but the best algorithms for random curves are exponential (record = 109 bits, for a slightly special curve). Up until now, people pick curves chosen from a small fixed set. One choice is a few curves with special properties that originally were chosen to make point-counting easier, and can also speed up the crypto operations, but in some cases they can also speed up attacks, not on curves deployed at the moment but the danger exists. The other choice is to precompute a handful of random curves. The NSA did this a few years ago when it took hours on a fast machine and NIST standardized those curves. What changes is that it is now possible is to generate your own curves on an ordinary PC. This has been getting easier and easier, with small curves taking seconds on a fast machine since a year or two. Now even reasonably big curves take seconds on a typical PC. This means that you don't have to rely on standard curves but can distribute risk over many curves in case some get broken at some stage. In certain circumstances you can even keep the curve itself secret so an attacker doesn't know which discrete log to try to compute! There isn't really a good analogy with RSA, but imagine wanting to factor a number and you don't even know what it is... So basically recent progress has made new things feasible and this makes them even more so. The underlying primitives for signing, encoding and so on are not affected, but the security vibes get better. R http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",

OK.\n \nThese results don't help break EC crypto at all.\n \nWith RSA, you pick a number with secret factors and to break the\ncryptosystem, you can factor the number.  Due to fast sub-exponential\nalgorithms for factoring, the number had better be 1024 bits at the\nvery least (record = 524 bits).\n \nWith EC, you pick a curve and pick points on the curve with secret\ndiscrete logarithm.  To break the cryptosystem you can compute a\ndiscrete log but the best algorithms for random curves are exponential\n(record = 109 bits, for a slightly special curve).\n \nUp until now, people pick curves chosen from a small fixed set.  One\nchoice is a few curves with special properties that originally were\nchosen to make point-counting easier, and can also speed up the crypto\noperations, but in some cases they can also speed up attacks, not on\ncurves deployed at the moment but the danger exists.  The other\nchoice is to precompute a handful of random curves.  The NSA did this\na few years ago when it took hours on a fast machine and NIST\nstandardized those curves.\n \nWhat changes is that it is now possible is to generate your own curves\non an ordinary PC.  This has been getting easier and easier, with\nsmall curves taking seconds on a fast machine since a year or two.\nNow even reasonably big curves take seconds on a typical PC.\n \nThis means that you don't have to rely on standard curves but can\ndistribute risk over many curves in case some get broken at some\nstage.  In certain circumstances you can even keep the curve itself\nsecret so an attacker doesn't know which discrete log to try to\ncompute!  There isn't really a good analogy with RSA, but imagine\nwanting to factor a number and you don't even know what it is...\n \nSo basically recent progress has made new things feasible and this\nmakes them even more so.  The underlying primitives for signing,\nencoding and so on are not affected, but the security vibes get better.\n \nR\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n"

I did 3 years of French in primary school and 6 in secondary school. So, that's 9 years of French. Which, I guess, should be long enough to be fluent in most languages. As it turns out, my French is crap. My Irish is much better. The problem seems to be the braindead attempt to make people learn languages they can't speak through reading and writing. And then tacking on speech as an afterthought. Whereas doing it the other way round would be a lot more useful... I hear this complaint a lot, but I never hear people complaining about being \"forced\" to learn to read and write, or to do maths. Maybe people don't mind as much if it is perceived as a useful skill (which Irish is not usually perceived as).

I don't think a ballistic missile defense system will be much help against a rock a couple thousand kilometers in diameter. That's WAY outside the design spec for any such system. Particularly when ballistic intercept designs usually don't have any type of warhead associated with them, either being kinetic or directed energy weapons. Contrary to popular belief, ballistic missile defense isn't a hard problem (ignoring whether or not it is useful). The only real challenge is materials science, as it really pushes the envelope of materials performance requirements to places they've never been; there has been some technology crossover with some of the new materials and processes they've had to come up with. The actual discrimination algorithms, while way more advanced than anything you'll see in the private sector (and classified, to keep it that way), are usually run on a crusty old MIPS R3k embedded processor or similar, with a low-to-mid range DSP to help out. It is not computationally intensive by any means. I used to be tangentially involved in various ballistic missile intercept weapon programs many years ago and am pretty familiar with the technologies that go into them. Most of the arguments against it from a technological standpoint are ignorant bullshit, and have lead me to believe that hardly anyone understands the technical parameters of ballistic missile intercept. And the arguments that are made without reference to the capability of the technology are neither particularly convincing nor conclusive. In summary: 1) Ballistic missile intercept technology is useless on a big rock. You are much better off using heavy-lift space technology to deliver a big nuke (or small nuke, depending on your plan). 2) State-of-the-art ballistic missile intercept technology is far more competent than most people imagine it is, and has discrimination capabilities that exceed most popular belief. It better be -- they've had twenty years to work on it. 3) I've never heard a really convincing argument against deploying ballistic missile intercept technology, particularly considering most of the R&D investment has already been made. I don't really care about it one way or the other, but I also don't see why other people have fits over it either. Cheers, -James Rogers jamesr@best.com http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",

That's WAY\noutside the design spec for any such system.  Particularly when\nballistic intercept designs usually don't have any type of warhead\nassociated with them, either being kinetic or directed energy weapons.\n\nContrary to popular belief, ballistic missile defense isn't a hard\nproblem (ignoring whether or not it is useful).  The only real challenge\nis materials science, as it really pushes the envelope of materials\nperformance requirements to places they've never been; there has been\nsome technology crossover with some of the new materials and processes\nthey've had to come up with.  The actual discrimination algorithms,\nwhile way more advanced than anything you'll see in the private sector\n(and classified, to keep it that way), are usually run on a crusty old\nMIPS R3k embedded processor or similar, with a low-to-mid range DSP to\nhelp out. It is not computationally intensive by any means.\n\nI used to be tangentially involved in various ballistic missile\nintercept weapon programs many years ago and am pretty familiar with the\ntechnologies that go into them.  Most of the arguments against it from a\ntechnological standpoint are ignorant bullshit, and have lead me to\nbelieve that hardly anyone understands the technical parameters of\nballistic missile intercept.  And the arguments that are made without\nreference to the capability of the technology are neither particularly\nconvincing nor conclusive.\n\nIn summary:\n\n1) Ballistic missile intercept technology is useless on a big rock.  You\nare much better off using heavy-lift space technology to deliver a big\nnuke (or small nuke, depending on your plan). \n\n2) State-of-the-art ballistic missile intercept technology is far more\ncompetent than most people imagine it is, and has discrimination\ncapabilities that exceed most popular belief.  It better be -- they've\nhad twenty years to work on it.\n\n3) I've never heard a really convincing argument against deploying\nballistic missile intercept technology, particularly considering most of\nthe R&D investment has already been made. I don't really care about it\none way or the other, but I also don't see why other people have fits\nover it either.\n\nCheers,\n\n-James Rogers\n jamesr@best.com\n\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\n\n\n"

Not sure Motif is a good example, really. When Mozilla was going through its \"Let's Use Motif/Let's Not\" phase, Jamie Zawinski mentioned in passing that the installed base of Motif-bearing systems kicked the installed base of Linux-bearing systems into a huddled ball. Something, perhaps, to do with the fact that every Sun/Solaris box since version mumble shipped with it, plus every HP/UX box, and for all I know every other mainstream proprietary Linux. Motif was more a unifier across Unix subspecies than a differentiator. Now, filenames longer than 14 characters, maybe, or the options for ps (are we sysv or bsd?), or the whole /dev tree, or the libc implementation...

Also connected to the hub are a laptop and workstation, both with RH7.3 . The server supplies DHCP amongst other things. The problem is interruptions in the network. If I ping the laptop from the workstation, or the other way around, there are no problems, i.e. shows up as 0% loss. If however I ping the server from the laptop or workstation, it will do a few packets, anywhere from 3 to 20, and then stop responding, it will start again after a little while. The server is definitely not overloaded, 128Mb, and seems to be configured correctly. In /etc/modules.conf,; options 3c507 irq=0x5 io=0x300 alias eth0 3c507 there is an option in there for something called hisax, but whatever that is, the machine doesn't have one. doing route shows 192.168.0.0 as going through eth0 which is correct.

    "body_text": "Geeklog XSS and CRLF Injection PROGRAM: Geeklog VENDOR: Tony Bibbs et al. <geeklog-devel@example.sourceforge.net> HOMEPAGE: http://geeklog.sourceforge.net/ VULNERABLE VERSIONS: 1.3.5sr1, possibly earlier versions as well NOT VULNERABLE VERSIONS: 1.3.5sr2 LOGIN REQUIRED: no SEVERITY: high DESCRIPTION: \"Geeklog is a 'blog', otherwise known as a Weblog. It allows you to create your own virtual community area, complete with user administration, story posting, messaging, comments, polls, calendar, weblinks, and more! It can run on many different operating systems, and uses PHP4 and MySQL.\" (direct quote from the program's homepage) Geeklog is published under the terms of the GNU General Public License. SECURITY HOLES: 1) Geeklog has got an XSS hole that affects both the stories and the comments. The program removes the HTML elements that are used for scripting, but it fails to remove the HTML attributes that are used for the same purpose, which leads to this hole. One example of an XSS attack would be: <b onMouseOver=\"self.location.href='http://localhost/geeklog/'\">life has made her that much bolder now</b> When a victim moves the mouse pointer over the quote from \"Lady Godiva's Operation\", an intrinsic event occurs and the JavaScript code is executed. (There is also an XSS issue in the search engine. It was reported by ome1, and not by me.) 2) Geeklog has got a CRLF Injection hole in User Profile: Send Email. The users' mail addresses are meant to be secret, but by using this hole, you can get someone's mail address anyway. The problem is that you can add extra mail headers, by using a CRLF combination followed by an extra mail header in the Subject field. One way to add them is saving the HTML document with the form, and changing the <input type=text name=subject> tag to a textarea. After opening the edited document in a web browser, you enter a Subject line in the textarea, press Enter, and then you enter your extra mail header. When the mail is sent, that header will be included. If the header in question is \"Bcc: <your own mail address>\", the message will silently be copied to you, thus revealing the recipient's mail address without them knowing. I have described this type of problem in further detail in my \"CRLF Injection\" paper, which is available at http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/archive/bugtraq/2002/05/msg00079.html COMMUNICATION WITH VENDOR: The vendor was contacted on the 1st of July. Version 1.3.5sr2, which does not have any of these security holes (neither mine nor ome1's), was released on the 9th of July.

It allows\nyou to create your own virtual community area, complete with user\nadministration, story posting, messaging, comments, polls, calendar,\nweblinks, and more! It can run on many different operating systems,\nand uses PHP4 and MySQL.\"\n\n(direct quote from the program's homepage)\n\nGeeklog is published under the terms of the GNU General Public\nLicense.\n\n\nSECURITY HOLES:\n\n1) Geeklog has got an XSS hole that affects both the stories and\nthe comments. The program removes the HTML elements that are used\nfor scripting, but it fails to remove the HTML attributes that are\nused for the same purpose, which leads to this hole.\n\nOne example of an XSS attack would be:\n\n<b onMouseOver=\"self.location.href='http://localhost/geeklog/'\">life\nhas made her that much bolder now</b>\n\nWhen a victim moves the mouse pointer over the quote from \"Lady\nGodiva's Operation\", an intrinsic event occurs and the JavaScript\ncode is executed.\n\n(There is also an XSS issue in the search engine. It was reported\nby ome1, and not by me.)\n\n2) Geeklog has got a CRLF Injection hole in User Profile: Send\nEmail. The users' mail addresses are meant to be secret, but by\nusing this hole, you can get someone's mail address anyway.\n\nThe problem is that you can add extra mail headers, by using a\nCRLF combination followed by an extra mail header in the Subject\nfield. One way to add them is saving the HTML document with the\nform, and changing the <input type=text name=subject> tag to a\ntextarea. After opening the edited document in a web browser, you\nenter a Subject line in the textarea, press Enter, and then you\nenter your extra mail header. When the mail is sent, that header\nwill be included. If the header in question is \"Bcc: <your own\nmail address>\", the message will silently be copied to you, thus\nrevealing the recipient's mail address without them knowing.\n\nI have described this type of problem in further detail\nin my \"CRLF Injection\" paper, which is available at\nhttp://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/archive/bugtraq/2002/05/msg00079.html\n\n\nCOMMUNICATION WITH VENDOR:\n\nThe vendor was contacted on the 1st of July. Version 1.3.5sr2,\nwhich does not have any of these security holes (neither mine nor\nome1's), was released on the 9th of July.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\n\nI recommend that all administrators upgrade to version 1.3.5sr2.\n\n\n// Ulf Harnhammar\nulfh@update.uu.se\n\n\n"

I've not seen any claim from SuSE of copyright over the distribution as a whole. (That would be a \"compilation copyright\", to use the legal term.) But they definitely assert (and in fact own) copyright over YaST, YaST2, and the associated installer program. So, if one wanted to distribute a version of SuSE free of encumbrances from SuSE Linux AG, one would merely have to write a replacement installer and do without YaST/YaST2 (and probably a few other things they wrote).

I _think_ this is true for all `cpio's (not just that GNU version), but am not certain. if you use an intermediate archive, e.g.: cpio -o ... >file; ...; cpio -i ... <file then the actual data bytes are copied into the archive (file) under each name (e.g., as both F1 and F2). but GNU `cpio' is smart about this in pass-through mode (`-p'), copying the data just once (or so I read the source). cheers! -blf- p.s. assuming this is a one-time operation that you won't repeat anytime soon (e.g., never; i.e., time isn't a major issue), and are not using any intermediate media/file (so storage isn't an issue), then even if `cpio' did read the data twice, so what? --- as long as, of course, it re-creates the hard links. which it will. -- Innovative, very experienced, Unix and | Brian Foster Dublin, Ireland Chorus (embedded RTOS) kernel internals | e-mail: blf@utvinternet.ie expert looking for a new position ... | mobile: (+353 or 0)86 854 9268 For a rsum, contact me, or see my website http://www.blf.utvinternet.ie Stop E$$o (ExxonMobile): Whatever you do, don't buy Esso --- they don't give a damn about global warming. http://www.stopesso.com Supported by Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, and numerous others... -- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

Well, yes, if I were to add all the frilly pink bits and the crunchy chocolate flavoured pieces... :) Seriously, I can only see two reasons to start another distro: you have something fundamentally different to offer, or you are customising an existing distro for an unusual and specific situation. Between Mandrake/YellowDog, RedHat/SuSe and Debian you have enough options to cover most day-to-day requirements. And a lot of the specific situations are already covered (smoothwall, familiar, etc.) Therefore, if I were to create a new Linux distribution, I would have to spend time crafting it so that it offers a lot more than existing alternatives. My requirements normally involve better support/easier maintenance, and if one follows the logic through, this would require a company to be behind such an initiative. I imagine it would be possible to create a new distribution in about one week[1]. For example: take Debian as your base, slap a specific set of packages on CD, change a few config files, mention that it has been untested on most hardware variations, and voila, a \"new\" distie. :) - Matthew [1] That is, IT weeks. 1 IT week ~= two months. :) __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

Between\nMandrake/YellowDog, RedHat/SuSe and Debian you have enough options to cover\nmost day-to-day requirements. And a lot of the specific situations are\nalready covered (smoothwall, familiar, etc.)\n\nTherefore, if I were to create a new Linux distribution, I would have to\nspend time crafting it so that it offers a lot more than existing\nalternatives. My requirements normally involve better support/easier\nmaintenance, and if one follows the logic through, this would require a\ncompany to be behind such an initiative.\n\nI imagine it would be possible to create a new distribution in about one\nweek[1]. For example: take Debian as your base, slap a specific set of\npackages on CD, change a few config files, mention that it has been untested\non most hardware variations, and voila, a \"new\" distie. :)\n\n- Matthew\n\n[1] That is, IT weeks. 1 IT week ~= two months. :)\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nEverything you'll ever need on one web page\nfrom News and Sport to Email and Music Charts\nhttp://uk.my.yahoo.com\n\n\n-- \nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\n\n\n"

Clearly you've never met \"Triumph\", the Fabulous Crotch-Sniffing Caymanian Customs Wonder Dog at extreme close range, or heard the story about the expat's college age kid, actually born on Cayman, who was literally exiled from the island when the island constabulary \"discovered\" a marijuana seed or three in his summer-break rental car a few years back. I mean, his old man was some senior cheese at Global Crossing at the time, but this was back when they could do no wrong. If that's what they did to *his* kid, imagine what some poor former junk-bond-hustler might have to deal with someday for, say, the odd unauthorized Cuban nightlife excursion. A discretely folded twenty keeps the stamp off your passport on the ground in Havana, and a bottle of Maker's Mark goes a long way towards some interesting nocturnal diversion when you get there and all, but still, you can't help thinking that Uncle's going to come a-knockin', and that Cayman van's going to stop rockin' some day, and when it does, it ain't gonna be pretty. Closer to home, conceptually at least, a couple of cryptogeeken were hustled off and strip-searched, on the spot, when they landed on Grand Cayman for the Financial Cryptography conference there a couple of years ago. Like lots of cypherpunks, these guys were active shooters in the Bay Area, and they had stopped in Jamaica, Mon, for a few days on the way to Grand Cayman. Because they, and their stuff, reeked on both counts, they were given complementary colorectal examinations and an entertaining game of 20 questions, or two, courtesy of the Caymanian Federales, after the obligatory fun and games with a then-snarling Crotch-Sniffing Caymanian Wonder Dog. Heck, I had to completely unpack *all* my stuff for a nice, well-fed Caymanian customs lady just to get *out* of the country when I left. Besides, tax havens are being increasingly constrained as to their activities these days, because they cost the larger nation-states too much in the way of \"escaped\" \"revenue\", or at least the perception of same in the local \"free\" press. Obviously, if your money \"there\" isn't exchangeable into your money \"here\", it kind of defeats the purpose of keeping your money \"there\" in the first place, giving folks like FinCEN lots of leverage when financial treaties come up for renegotiation due to changes in technology, like on-line credit-card and securities clearing, or the odd governmental or quango re-org, like they are wont to do increasingly in the EU, and the US. As a result, the veil of secrecy went in Switzerland quite a while ago. The recent holocaust deposit thing was just the bride and groom on that particular wedding-cake, and, as goes Switzerland, so goes Luxembourg, and of course Lichtenstein, which itself is usually accessible only through Switzerland. Finally, of course, the Caymans themselves will cough up depositor lists whenever Uncle comes calling about one thing or another on an increasingly longer list of fishing pretexts. At this point, the \"legal\", state-backed pecuniary privacy pickings are kind of thin on the ground. I mean, I'm not sure I'd like to keep my money in, say, Vanuatu. Would you? Remember, this is a place where a bandana hanging on a string across an otherwise public road will close it down until the local erst-cannibal hunter-gatherer turned statutorily-permanent landowner figures out just what his new or imagined property rights are this afternoon. The point is, any cypherpunk worth his salt will tell you that only solution to financial or any other, privacy, is to make private transactions on the net, cheaper, and more secure, than \"transparent\" transactions currently are in meatspace. Then things get *real* interesting, and financial privacy -- and considerably more personal freedom -- will just be the icing on the wedding cake. Bride and groom action figures sold separately, of course. Cheers, RAH (Who went to FC2K at the Grand Cayman Marriott in February that year. Nice place, I liked Anguilla better though, at least at the time, and I haven't been back to either since. The beaches are certainly better in Anguilla, and the \"private\" banking system there is probably just as porous as Cayman's is, by this point. If I were to pick up and move Somewhere Free outside Your Friendly Neighborhood Unipolar Superpower, New Zealand is somewhere near the top of my list, and Chile would be next, though things change quickly out there in ballistic-missile flyover country. In that vein, who knows, maybe we're in for some kind of latter-day Peloponnesian irony, and *Russia* will end up the freest place on earth someday. Stranger things have happened in the last couple of decades, yes?) -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: PGP 7.5 iQA/AwUBPVYS48PxH8jf3ohaEQKwtgCgw/XSwzauabEP/8jDvUVk/rgFdroAn0xf Owk90GoK+X5Pv+bGoKXCwzBK =1w9d -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- -- ----------------- R.

Small non-interventionist\n> government.\n\nClearly you've never met \"Triumph\", the Fabulous Crotch-Sniffing\nCaymanian Customs Wonder Dog at extreme close range, or heard the\nstory about the expat's college age kid, actually born on Cayman, who\nwas literally exiled from the island when the island constabulary\n\"discovered\" a marijuana seed or three in his summer-break rental car\na few years back.\n\nI mean, his old man was some senior cheese at Global Crossing at the\ntime, but this was back when they could do no wrong. If that's what\nthey did to *his* kid, imagine what some poor former\njunk-bond-hustler might have to deal with someday for, say, the odd\nunauthorized Cuban nightlife excursion. A discretely folded twenty\nkeeps the stamp off your passport on the ground in Havana, and a\nbottle of Maker's Mark goes a long way towards some interesting\nnocturnal diversion when you get there and all, but still, you can't\nhelp thinking that Uncle's going to come a-knockin', and that Cayman\nvan's going to stop rockin' some day, and when it does, it ain't\ngonna be pretty.\n\n\nCloser to home, conceptually at least, a couple of cryptogeeken were\nhustled off and strip-searched, on the spot, when they landed on\nGrand Cayman for the Financial Cryptography conference there a couple\nof years ago. Like lots of cypherpunks, these guys were active\nshooters in the Bay Area, and they had stopped in Jamaica, Mon, for a\nfew days on the way to Grand Cayman. Because they, and their stuff,\nreeked on both counts, they were given complementary colorectal\nexaminations and an entertaining game of 20 questions, or two,\ncourtesy of the Caymanian Federales, after the obligatory fun and\ngames with a then-snarling Crotch-Sniffing Caymanian Wonder Dog.\nHeck, I had to completely unpack *all* my stuff for a nice, well-fed\nCaymanian customs lady just to get *out* of the country when I left.\n\n\nBesides, tax havens are being increasingly constrained as to their\nactivities these days, because they cost the larger nation-states too\nmuch in the way of \"escaped\" \"revenue\", or at least the perception of\nsame in the local \"free\" press. Obviously, if your money \"there\"\nisn't exchangeable into your money \"here\", it kind of defeats the\npurpose of keeping your money \"there\" in the first place, giving\nfolks like FinCEN lots of leverage when financial treaties come up\nfor renegotiation due to changes in technology, like on-line\ncredit-card and securities clearing, or the odd governmental or\nquango re-org, like they are wont to do increasingly in the EU, and\nthe US.\n\nAs a result, the veil of secrecy went in Switzerland quite a while\nago. The recent holocaust deposit thing was just the bride and groom\non that particular wedding-cake, and, as goes Switzerland, so goes\nLuxembourg, and of course Lichtenstein, which itself is usually\naccessible only through Switzerland. Finally, of course, the Caymans\nthemselves will cough up depositor lists whenever Uncle comes calling\nabout one thing or another on an increasingly longer list of fishing\npretexts.\n\nAt this point, the \"legal\", state-backed pecuniary privacy pickings\nare kind of thin on the ground. I mean, I'm not sure I'd like to keep\nmy money in, say, Vanuatu. Would you? Remember, this is a place where\na bandana hanging on a string across an otherwise public road will\nclose it down until the local erst-cannibal hunter-gatherer turned\nstatutorily-permanent landowner figures out just what his new or\nimagined property rights are this afternoon.\n\n\nThe point is, any cypherpunk worth his salt will tell you that only\nsolution to financial or any other, privacy, is to make private\ntransactions on the net, cheaper, and more secure, than \"transparent\"\ntransactions currently are in meatspace. Then things get *real*\ninteresting, and financial privacy -- and considerably more personal\nfreedom -- will just be the icing on the wedding cake. Bride and\ngroom action figures sold separately, of course.\n\nCheers,\nRAH\n(Who went to FC2K at the Grand Cayman Marriott in February that year.\nNice place, I liked Anguilla better though, at least at the time, and\nI haven't been back to either since. The beaches are certainly better\nin Anguilla, and the \"private\" banking system there is probably just\nas porous as Cayman's is, by this point. If I were to pick up and\nmove Somewhere Free outside Your Friendly Neighborhood Unipolar\nSuperpower, New Zealand is somewhere near the top of my list, and\nChile would be next, though things change quickly out there in\nballistic-missile flyover country. In that vein, who knows, maybe\nwe're in for some kind of latter-day Peloponnesian irony, and\n*Russia* will end up the freest place on earth someday. Stranger\nthings have happened in the last couple of decades, yes?)\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: PGP 7.5\n\niQA/AwUBPVYS48PxH8jf3ohaEQKwtgCgw/XSwzauabEP/8jDvUVk/rgFdroAn0xf\nOwk90GoK+X5Pv+bGoKXCwzBK\n=1w9d\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n-- \n-----------------\nR.

Installation is WELL detailed, you should see the NV splash screen, don;t forget to edit the config files. CW -------------------------------------- Hi I have just installed Red Hat 7.2 on my desktop machine. I am completely new to Linux and therefore have run into a few problems. The graphic display on my PC doesnt seem to work. My monitor is slightly miss-aligned and I cannot run any high resolution games ( everything freezes ). In the hardware browser in Gnome it lists my Graphics Card (Riva TNT2), and shows installed drivers...... maybe the problem lies elswhere. Another problem I have is that I cannot install my ISDN, USB modem ( LASAT Speed Basic ), however im pretty sure its not supported by Linux, but again it is featured in the Hardware Browser, without installed drivers. If anybody has any ideas, please let me know cos id like to use Linux more. Please keep in mind I am new to it though.

Naw, I still disagree, again because if I'm going to be so loose with the definitions, then I'd have to say that I myself am a genetically engineered organism. But I'm natural, baby. My parents were attracted to each other's phenotypes, mixed some genes in the hopes that those genotypes would get in there, and grew me around them. Sure, they engineered the process when they selected each other. But they didn't engineer the genetics. If genetic enginering wasn't such an important topic today, it wouldn't be such an important distinction. I guess that the reason that I disagree is that some groups arguing against any checks on genetic engineering use that same argument - \"we've been doing it since prehistory, so we don't need to apply any caution today\". -- Karl Anderson kra@monkey.org http://www.monkey.org/~kra/ http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",

The GPL makes no stipulations about charging for binaries. In fact, you can go get the sources for, say, GNU's /bin/true, compile it yourself and try selling the resulting binary for EUR 1000. (And, with a good enough sales pitch, you just might get away with it!) However, what the GPL does stipulate is that you must provide the sources for that binary if asked. So I might buy it from you for EUR 1000, compile it myself and sell that binary for EUR 1. Of course, I'll need to provide the sources to anyone that asks as well. But, I just might make money at this, since there might be a market of 10000 people who would pay 1 euro for the convenience of getting a binary. But then, John Looney would step in, buy it from me for 1 euro, burn it and the sources and some of his favourite /bin/true patches on a CD and duplicate it for the cost of the media or a cream bun, depending on how hungry he is. You see, the GPL doesn't force the binaries to be zero-cost (or cost-of-media), but it puts a really big hole in any business plan that solely resells GPL software. You _can_ charge for it if you want, but you bloody well better be providing some value for that money, or you'll go out of business faster than a dot-com in 2001. And there are real ways to provide this value for money (convenience of getting it on one CD, convenience of a friendly installer, convenience of vendor-supplied updates, convenience of having what lots of other people have, posting a CD and paying a few euro is cheaper than downloading over a modem, warm fuzzy feeling of getting something from a \"real\" company, etc). There will be segments of the market that will pay various amounts for GPL software and there will be others that don't. Thankfully, the GPL allows for both, _by_design_. But the source will always be free (or minimal cost). Later, Kenn -- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

Assuming a 2km-wide --- that is, 20 000 decimeter-wide --- spherical asteroid of specific gravity 10, 4/3 pi r^3 says it would have a volume of 4e12 cubic decimeters and thus a mass of 4e13 kg. The force we'd have to apply to achieve this acceleration would be roughly equivalent to the weight of 200 kg here on Earth. So, yeah, ion drives are probably a no-go, unless I screwed up the calculations here; I think the force they typically exert is about four orders of magnitude too small. If we just wanted to hit today it with enough of an impulse that it would miss us 17 years later, we'd need to accelerate it by about 1.1 cm/s. A one-ton (1000kg) mass would need to hit it at about 4e9 m/s, or about ten times the speed of light, to achieve this, so that's not possible. (If you could actually put enough work into a one-ton mass, as it approached the speed of light, it would mass more, so you could still do it with a one-ton mass; but we don't have anything approaching that speed.) The impulse required is inversely proportional to the remaining time to impact, so if we were to hit it after half the time has elapsed, we'd need to accelerate it by around 2.2 cm/s instead. The gravitational force of an Earth-sized mass could provide sufficient deflection if that mass were about 4.5e5 times as far away from the asteroid as we are from Earth's center, or about 2.7e9 m, or about 0.018 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun (0.018 AU). (And if that mass stayed so nearby for 17 years.) The effects of continuous acceleration benefit greatly from planning ahead, since they scale with t^2, not t --- and thus the needed acceleration scales with 1/t^2. After half the time has elapsed, we'd need four times as much acceleration to make it miss the Earth than if we were to start accelerating it now. All of these numbers are a little low, because the Earth presents a slightly easier target than its physical size suggests, due to its gravity well. How much easier depends on the speed of the projectile in ways I don't understand. They're also a little high, because they assume the force is being applied purely at right angles to the asteroid's current path, which is a slightly suboptimal scenario (although for velocity changes five orders of magnitude smaller than the relative velocity, the difference is probably insignificant.) And they assume there are no other effects on the asteroid's path. What about electrical charges? Could we electrically charge the asteroid and another nearby asteroid, perhaps with electron beams, to provide the needed acceleration? Of course, all of this calculation could be applied in the other direction, too. If you want to sock a moon colony with a one-ton asteroid, you could do it with a tiny amount of force applied over twenty-five years to adjust its orbit. *** About spam: I'm sorry to admit I haven't implemented any of the better solutions, and so I'm afraid I'll have to allow non-subscriber FoRK mail to be detained for scanning. I hope this measure can be reversed soon when I have time to implement better measures. As has often been noted by other posters, measures to reduce spam sent to the FoRK list will not significantly decrease the spam load of FoRKposters, since the vast majority of spam received by FoRKposters is sent to them directly, not through the FoRK list. -- <kragen@pobox.com> Kragen Sitaker <http://www.pobox.com/~kragen/> Silence may not be golden, but at least it's quiet.
